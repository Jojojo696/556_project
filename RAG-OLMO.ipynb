    "The RAG based approach below is a demonstration of how to use [OLMo-1B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-1B) LLM model by AI2 to generate an abstract completion for a given input text. The input text is a random starting abstract from `astro-ph` category of [ArXiv Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). The abstract completion is generated by the model using the RAG approach. The RAG approach retrieves relevant documents from [Qdrant Vector Database](https://qdrant.tech/), which provides contextual information to the model for generating the completion.\n",

This depends on many factors such as the initial mass of the star, the metallicity of the environment, etc. Third, we need to know how much time does it take for the star to cool down after reaching its maximum luminosity. This depends on many factors such as the initial temperature of the star, the density of the interstellar medium, etc. Fourth, we need to know how much time does it take for the star to lose its angular momentum due to the gravitational force of the Sun. This depends on many factors such as the initial angular momentum of the star, the distance between the star and the Sun, etc. Fifth, we need to know how much time does it take for the star to lose its magnetic field due to the interaction with the surrounding magnetic fields. This depends on many factors such as the initial magnetic field strength of the star, the strength of the external magnetic field, etc. Sixth, we need to know how much time does it take for the star to lose its rotational velocity due to the centrifugal force of the Sun.

       "'  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\\n   Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)\\nhas made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are\\nreduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and\\narchived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The\\ndata-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over\\nthe lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been\\nreprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper\\ndescribes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and\\nthe format of the resulting calibrated data files.\\n'"
