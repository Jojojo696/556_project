If you are interested in Apache Lucene, I\u2019m linking below other posts from the Exploring Apache Lucene series where I\u2019m discussing its architecture in a bottom-up manner: Exploring Apache Lucene - Part 1: The Index Exploring Apache Lucene - Part 2: Search and Ranking Lucene at scale As search volumes and datasets grow, maintaining high performance with Apache Lucene can become increasingly challenging. As a result, scaling Lucene-based search engines becomes a crucial consideration for data-driven businesses. There are several open-source implementations that can help achieve this goal. I\u2019m personally familiar with Elasticsearch and nrtSearch , and I will use them to talk about different architectures. Both Elasticsearch and nrtSearch allow you to scale out Lucene across multiple nodes, with an added API wrapper for data ingestion and search. But their different designs and architectures make the problem of running Lucene at scale quite interesting. While they all aim to solve the same problem, their specific implementations have different tradeoffs in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of use. Let\u2019s start with discussing the foundations. Data distribution If your searches are starting to take longer or your index is getting too large for a node to handle, it might be time to consider distributing your data across multiple nodes. To do this, you can divide your index into smaller partitions, called shards, which can then be distributed across separate nodes. A search engine can partition a search query into sub-searches that are run on each shard, and then the results are combined - this is known as Scatter-gather . The underlying technical details of index sharding are typically invisible to end users. They\u2019ll simply experience faster search performance, especially when working with very large indexes. By distributing your data, you can overcome physical limitations and improve search efficiency. Data replication When you have large search volumes that can\u2019t be handled by a single node, you can distribute searches across multiple read-only copies of the index to improve search performance. By replicating the index, search queries can be processed concurrently across multiple nodes, resulting in faster response times for end-users. This makes it possible to handle large volumes of data and queries, which is critical for building a high-performing, scalable search engine. Data replication implies keeping the primary node in sync with all of its replicas and can increase the ingestion overhead. High volumes of indexing can consume extra resources and effectively reduce search performance. There are two main approaches to supporting data replication in Lucene: document replication : each replica indexes documents into index segments. A given quorum of replicas has to acknowledge the success of the insertion request for it to be considered successful by the primary. segment replication : only the primary ingests documents; new index segments are transferred to all replicas. This approach comes with less overhead as only the primary actually indexes the data; it guarantees point-in-time consistency. With document-based replication , primary and replica shards are constantly communicating to stay in sync. They do this by replicating the operations performed on the primary shard to the replica shard, which means that the cost of those operations (CPU, mainly) is incurred for each replica specified. The same shards and nodes doing this work for ingest are also serving search requests, so provisioning and scaling must be done with both workloads in mind. With segment-based replication , you can separate indexing and searching by replicating the index. This allows you to distribute indexing and searching across different nodes, which can help improve search performance and reduce the load on any one node. The approach effectively trades higher CPU consumption by the replicas for increased network consumption (transferring whole segments to replicas). By separating indexing and searching, you can ensure that your search engine remains performant and responsive, even as your indexing needs grow. Load balancing When your Lucene-powered search system experiences increased traffic, maintaining consistent performance becomes crucial. Some distributed search engines, such as Elasticsearch, come with their own built-in node discovery and load balancing mechanisms. These can either replace or complement traditional load balancers like Nginx or HAProxy. By intelligently distributing the workload across multiple nodes, these systems ensure that no single node is overwhelmed, resulting in a responsive and reliable search experience for users. Through load balancing, your search infrastructure gains the ability to scale horizontally: you can dynamically add or remove nodes without disrupting service availability. Load balancers often integrate health checks, monitoring the health of individual nodes and automatically directing traffic away from underperforming or unavailable nodes. By eliminating single points of failure and maximizing resource efficiency, load balancing contributes significantly to reliability and scalability. Scaling Effectively One common issue encountered in distributed systems is the time it takes for a new node to join the cluster and become fully operational. This delay can impact immediate responsiveness during peak traffic periods. To mitigate this challenge, the resources are often over-provisioned to ensure adequate capacity for traffic spikes or region failovers. However, over-provisioning can lead to unnecessary costs and waste of resources during non-peak times. Stateless Deployment Historically, most of Lucene deployments have been stateful. Nodes in such deployments heavily rely on local disks, and scaling often meant managing complex data transfer and node synchronization mechanisms. However, as the software ecosystem evolves towards more modular and scalable patterns, stateless is emerging as a preferred approach for deploying large-scale applications, including search. The future is stateless. According to Stateless \u2014 your new state of find with Elasticsearch blog. While Lucene itself inherently deals with indexed data stored on disk, modern deployment techniques can introduce a form of statelessness in distributed search engines built on Lucene. The stateless architecture might involve moving the persistent layer from local disc to external storage solutions like Amazon S3, while the search nodes themselves are kept stateless. Stateless containers, housing individual Lucene instances, can be rapidly spun up or down to match demand. For example, Kubernetes\u2019 dynamic scaling and automated workload distribution can ensure that new nodes are ready to serve traffic swiftly, eliminating the need for excessive resource reservation. This approach optimizes resource utilization, reduces costs, and enables your search cluster to seamlessly handle varying workloads. For instance, Nrtsearch: Yelp\u2019s Fast, Scalable and Cost Effective Search Engine blog post highlights the advantages they gained from transitioning to a stateless Lucene-based search engine. The significant cost benefits stemmed primarily from the system\u2019s capability to swiftly auto-scale in response to fluctuating user traffic. Managed Serverless in the Cloud The evolution of serverless architecture has reached a new level, with cloud providers offering fully managed serverless services. With these services, users no longer need to concern themselves with the underlying infrastructure, such as provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. This shift allows developers to focus solely on building search functionalities and user experiences. Scaling Efficiently and Cost-effectively Stateless architectures simplify auto-scaling and minimize wasted resources. This flexibility often leads to substantial cost savings for the developer. Although moving to a stateless approach can introduce challenges, such as data consistency issues, the financial and operational advantages typically outweigh the drawbacks. Elasticsearch Architecture Elasticsearch runs on a stateful setup with a cluster at the core of its architecture. A cluster is a group of interconnected nodes that collectively manage and serve data. There are different types of nodes: data nodes store data, master-eligible nodes decide which node is in charge, and coordinating nodes manage search queries. Data in Elasticsearch is split into parts called shards . This makes it easy to spread data across many nodes and grow the system. Primary shards handle data writing and manage copies called replicas. Replicas are backups; if one shard has an issue, a replica takes over. Coordinating nodes receive search requests, send them to the right shards, and calculate the answers. They don\u2019t hold data, but they manage the flow of search requests. Data is organized into different lifecycle stages for efficient storage and access: hot for frequently accessed data, cold for less frequently accessed data, and frozen for archival data. Nodes can be specifically configured or optimized to handle data at each of these stages. In a real-world scenario where Elasticsearch was used for a search application with heavy user traffic, I\u2019ve witnessed several issues with that setup: Document-based replication issues : In Elasticsearch, each replica indexes documents individually. This means that as you scale out with more replicas, CPU demands for indexing increase, leading to escalated costs. Shard distribution issues : Elasticsearch\u2019s automatic shard distribution can lead to \u201chot\u201d nodes (overwhelmed with traffic) and \u201ccold\u201d nodes (underutilized). Sometimes manual intervention is needed to ensure a balanced spread of shards for optimized CPU usage. Autoscaling Issues : Real-time scaling is challenging due to the need to migrate shards between nodes, causing provisioning for peak capacity. The necessity for a balanced shard distribution complicates autoscaling further, as scaling adjustments (number of new nodes joining the cluster) must align with the number of shards and replicas in each index. Stateful and stateless Elasticsearch is transitioning towards a stateless architecture , marking a significant departure from its traditional stateful design. In this new model, data persistence moves from local node disks to external blob storage platforms such as AWS S3. By doing so, there is no need for duplicating indexing across replica nodes, and it significantly reduces associated costs. Elasticsearch is evolving its operational structure: instead of mixing indexing and search operations on the same instances, they\u2019ll be separated into distinct tiers. This separation means each function, indexing and searching, can scale based on its specific needs, enhancing both efficiency and performance. Nrtsearch While working as a software engineer at Yelp, I was part of the Ranking Platform team. We were at the core of an initiative to revamp the core search and ranking infrastructure in terms of performance and cost efficiency. This effort resulted in an open-source project - nrtsearch - which, as of 2023, is used for the majority of search and ranking use cases at Yelp. You can read more about the nrtsearch project results in the blog post from Yelp\u2019s Engineering Blog: Nrtsearch: Yelp\u2019s Fast, Scalable and Cost Effective Search Engine If you are interested in running the nrtsearch multi-node cluster locally, you can refer to the official docs or follow: Nrtsearch Tutorial - Indexing Web Content for Search with the tutorial repo . Stateless architecture Nrtsearch is a search engine developed with specific design goals, including utilizing Lucene\u2019s capabilities and ensuring near-real-time segment replication. Nrtsearch is built on Lucene, which enables the reuse of custom Java code for features like ML-based ranking, analysis, highlighting, and suggestions. The cluster is at the core of its architecture. It consists of a single primary and replicas. Primary node - a single node, responsible for data indexing. It periodically publishes Lucene segment updates to replicas. Hence the name: nrtsearch - near-real time search . Replica nodes - one or more nodes, responsible for serving the search traffic. It receives periodic segment updates from the primary. The number of running replicas can be controlled by an auto-scaler (like HPA ) to respond to changing search load. Instead of relying on a node\u2019s local storage, the primary copy of the index is stored externally, such as on Amazon S3. This setup ensures nodes can be swiftly rebooted without the need for local instance storage backups. The primary carries out the bulk of the work. When the primary indexes documents, it sends updates to all replicas. Replicas receive the latest segments from the primary over the network. This method effectively trades higher CPU consumption by the replicas for increased network consumption, as replicas don\u2019t need index documents to Lucene segments on their own. However, with high networking bandwidth becoming more affordable over time, this is a feasible approach. The near-real-time segment replication offers point-in-time consistency. Nrtsearch doesn\u2019t include a transaction log. Clients are expected to periodically call commit to persist recent changes. If a primary node crashes, documents indexed since the last commit might be lost, but an external ETL system, like Flink, can revert to a checkpoint and resend indexing requests. Outside of Nrtsearch, Kubernetes helps in addressing deployment challenges, such as replacing a failed primary or replica pod. Load balancing across replicas is managed on the client-side with gRPC load balancing. In cases where data doesn\u2019t fit onto a single primary (index size > 30GB), the index can be divided across multiple clusters. Each of these clusters has its own primary and a set of replicas. To manage such a distributed setup efficiently, a scatter-gather service needs to be used - unfortunately, it has not been open-sourced by Yelp as of 2023. This service coordinates both indexing across clusters and distributed querying. When a query is made, it\u2019s scattered across the clusters, and each cluster processes its portion of the query. Once processed, the results are gathered and combined before being returned to the user. Nrtsearch was built for cost-saving and easy auto-scaling. However, it\u2019s not as user-friendly as some alternatives. Unlike Elastic\u2019s stack with open-source tools like Kibana, nrtsearch doesn\u2019t have as many tutorials, user docs, or publicly available scatter-gather and k8s operator service. So, while it does its main job well, you might need more setup and integration work to get everything running smoothly. \u2190Nrtsearch Tutorial - Indexing Web Content for Search Elastic Data Connectors - Elasticsearch Ingestion Made Simple\u2192 Jedr's Blog \u2022 Tech Blog Blog by Jedr Blaszyk .Tech, cycling, photography & travelling.

My work is focused on applying Geometric Deep Learning methods for shape analysis in the medical setting. The first post is an overview of Geometric Deep Learning. Geometric deep learning (GDL) , a term first proposed by Bronstein et al. [1] , has emerged aiming to generalize deep learning models to non-Euclidean domains. This novel field in the world of machine learning was successfully used for building recommender systems [2] , protein function prediction [3] , fake news detection [4] , and detection of cancer-beating molecules in food [5] . GDL owes its success to the fact that it operates directly on the relational structure of a given problem. An example of such a structure is a graph. It can describe various concepts ranging from a social network to a chemical compound. Most GNN architectures are based on message passing (spatial methods), where at each layer the nodes update their hidden representations by aggregating information they collect from their neighbours. A crucial difference from traditional neural networks operating on grid-structured data is the absence of canonical ordering of the nodes in a graph. To address this, usually the aggregation function is constructed to be invariant to neighbourhood permutations. Non-Euclidean domains Graph. A graph G G G is a pair ( V , E ) (V,E) ( V , E ) with the finite set of vertices V V V and edges E E E . It captures interactions (edges) between individual units (nodes). Manifold. A manifold is a is a locally Euclidean space. In computer graphics, shapes are represented as discrete 2-dimensional manifolds. A discrete manifold has vertices uniformly sampled from the surface of the manifold with edges expressing the local structure of the shape. It\u2019s commonly called a triangular mesh. Spectral methods Spectral methods were the first approach to generalize convolution operation to non-Euclidean domains. In practice, they are rarely used because they are computationally inefficient and don\u2019t generalize well to different domains. Spectral graph convolution draws inspiration from the Euclidean convolution in a spectral domain. The Fourier basis is used to compute spectral convolution in the classical signal processing (Read this for an in-depth explanation of Convolution theorem). Given a graph, one way to generalize a convolutional architecture is to look at linear operators that commute with the graph Laplacian. This property implies operating on the spectrum of the graph weights, given by the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. The concept of graph convolution is explained more in-depth in here . Spatial methods Spatial methods are preferred over the spectral methods for a number of reasons . The spatial convolution is considered a more versatile method for learning on non-Euclidean structures. Figure 1: 2D Convolution vs. Graph Convolution. Spatial methods define graph convolutions based on a node\u2019s spatial relations, which is analogous to the convolution operation on the classical CNN. Images can be considered a special form of a graph with each pixel representing a node, connected to each neighboring pixels. A filter would be applied on the patch of the image including the pixel and its neighboring nodes. Similarly, spatial methods convolve a given node\u2019s features, using a patch operator, with its neighbors\u2019 features. The intuition about the spatial graph convolutions is that this operation propagates and updates node features along edges. Why spatial is better than spectral Spatial models are preferred over spectral models due to efficiency, generality, and flexibility issues. Spectral models are less efficient than spatial models as they need to perform eigendecomposition or handle the whole graph at the same time (e.g. mesh completion scenario). Spatial models are more scalable to large graphs as they directly perform convolutions in the graph domain via information propagation (i.e. message passing). The computation can be performed in a batch of nodes instead of the whole graph. Moreover, spectral models assume a fixed graph and because they rely on a graph Fourier basis they generalize poorly to new graphs. This is because any perturbation to a graph results in a change of eigenbasis. Spatial models perform graph convolutions locally on each node, which allows for weight sharing across different structures and locations. Finally, spectral methods are limited to undirected graphs whereas spatial methods can handle a bigger variety of graphs such as edge inputs, directed graphs, signed graphs and heterogeneous graphs because of the flexibility of the aggregation function Introduction by example: GCN implemented in PyTorch Geometric PyTorch Geometric [6] is a geometric deep learning extension library for PyTorch. It is a library for deep learning on irregularly structured input data such as graphs, point clouds, and manifolds, also known as geometric deep learning, from a variety of published papers. It consists of an easy-to-use mini-batch loader for many small and single big graphs, multi gpu-support and a large number of common benchmark datasets. PyTorch Geometric makes use of Generic Message Passing Scheme to implement any convolutional operator. The message passing scheme consists of 2 steps: propagate step - messages from nodes are propagated to their local neighborhoods. update step - embedded node\u2019s features are updated by the message vector. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) was defined by Kipf et al. [7] . The intuition of this method is that it can alleviate the problem of overfitting on local neighborhood structures for graphs with very wide node degree distributions, such as social networks, citation networks, and many other real-world graph datasets. The computational complexity of this approach is O ( n ) O(n) O ( n ) . It applies simple filters acting on the 1-hop neighborhood of the graph in the spatial domain. It can be expressed in the generic message-passing scheme as: msg ( x i , x j ) = 1 deg \u2061 ( x i ) d e g ( x j ) ( x j \u0398 ) \\text{msg}(x_i, x_j) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\deg(x_i)} \\sqrt{deg(x_j)}} \\left( \\mathbf{x}_j \\mathbf{\\Theta} \\right) msg ( x i \u200b , x j \u200b ) = de g ( x i \u200b ) \u200b d e g ( x j \u200b ) \u200b 1 \u200b ( x j \u200b \u0398 ) x \u2032 i = \u2211 j \u2208 N ( i ) \u222a { i } msg ( x i , x j ) \\mathbf{x'}_i = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i) \\cup \\{ i \\}} \\text{msg}(x_i, x_j) x \u2032 i \u200b = j \u2208 N ( i ) \u222a { i } \u2211 \u200b msg ( x i \u200b , x j \u200b ) where neighboring node features are first transformed by a weight matrix \u0398 \\mathbf{\\Theta} \u0398 , normalized by their degree, and finally summed up. This formula can be divided into the following steps: Add self-loops to the adjacency matrix. Linearly transform node feature matrix. Normalize node features. Sum up neighboring node features. Return new node embeddings. Pytorch Geometric provides the MessagePassing class, all we need to do to implement GCN is write our update() and message() functions. class GCNConv ( MessagePassing ) : def __init__ ( self , in_channels , out_channels ) : super ( GCNConv , self ) . __init__ ( aggr = 'add' ) # \"Add\" aggregation. self . lin = torch . nn . Linear ( in_channels , out_channels ) def forward ( self , x , edge_index ) : # x has shape [N, in_channels] # edge_index has shape [2, E] # Step 1: Add self-loops to the adjacency matrix. edge_index = add_self_loops ( edge_index , num_nodes = x . size ( 0 ) ) # Step 2: Linearly transform node feature matrix. x = self . lin ( x ) # Step 3-5: Start propagating messages. return self . propagate ( edge_index , x = x ) def message ( self , x_j , edge_index , size ) : # x_j has shape [E, out_channels] # Step 3: Normalize node features. row , col = edge_index deg = degree ( row , size [ 0 ] , dtype = x_j . dtype ) deg_inv_sqrt = deg . pow ( - 0.5 ) deg_inv_sqrt [ deg_inv_sqrt == float ( 'inf' ) ] = 0 norm = deg_inv_sqrt [ row ] * deg_inv_sqrt [ col ] return norm . view ( - 1 , 1 ) * x_j def update ( self , aggr_out ) : # aggr_out has shape [N, out_channels] # Step 5: Return new node embeddings. return aggr_out Note: Step 4 is done by setting aggr='add' when initialising GCNConv . Wasn\u2019t too bad, right? PyTorch Geometric offers implementations of most popular convolutional layers and provides lots of examples. Check it out on github . Now we can get our hands dirty with a real-world problem. The Cora dataset consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes. The citation network consists of 5429 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a 0/1-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. We can create a simple model for the semi-supervised classication of each publication in the graph. Our model is constructed as follows: class Net ( torch . nn . Module ) : def __init__ ( self ) : super ( Net , self ) . __init__ ( ) self . conv1 = GCNConv ( dataset . num_features , 16 ) self . conv2 = GCNConv ( 16 , dataset . num_classes ) def forward ( self ) : x , edge_index , edge_weight = data . x , data . edge_index , data . edge_attr x = F . relu ( self . conv1 ( x , edge_index , edge_weight ) ) x = F . dropout ( x , training = self . training ) x = self . conv2 ( x , edge_index , edge_weight ) return F . log_softmax ( x , dim = 1 ) With just 140 nodes in the training set we are able to achieve >80% classification accuracy for the rest of the nodes, the resulting classified Cora dataset looks as follows: Figure 2: Semi-supervised node classification result on Cora dataset. It shows that Geometric Deep Learning is an elegant and performant approach when dealing with non-Euclidean structures.

Following our recent adventures in Scandinavia ( Swedish Coastline , Kattegat Loop , Norway Expedition ), we decided to explore sunny Provence in France. Lavender fields, delicious French pastries, and mighty High Alps on the horizon accompanied us throughout the week-long adventure. Welcome to the photo report from our bikepacking trip to Provence and the Hautes-Alpes. Our adventure had two parts. First, we spent five days bikepacking on fully loaded bikes around Verdon Natural Regional Park . Then we drove to Hautes-Alpes, near Brian\u00e7on, the highest city in France, to tackle two famous Tour de France climbs: Col de Vars and Col d\u2019Izoard. Provence: Tour du Verdon Provence and Hautes-Alpes Distance: 580km Elevation: 11100m Time: 7 days Date: Sep 2023 Route We began our trip in Digne, leaving our car there. On the first day, we biked to the beautiful mountain town of Moustiers-Sainte-Marie. The second day was dedicated to cycling around Lac de Sainte-Croix, where we stopped at charming villages for coffee and delicious French pastries. I particularly enjoyed the northwestern part of the lake, where we rode through lavender fields that must look stunning when in bloom during spring. Our last three days were spent cycling along Canyon Verdon and exploring the southern area of Parc naturel r\u00e9gional du Verdon. Parc naturel r\u00e9gional du Verdon The Verdon National Park in France is a stunning natural area known for its deep canyon, turquoise river, and dramatic limestone cliffs. It\u2019s a fantastic destination for bikepacking, offering scenic routes, beautiful mountain towns, and opportunities to explore the picturesque landscapes of Provence. The iconic Canyon Verdon is a highlight of the park\u2019s rugged beauty. Moreover, in every village we passed through, we found patisseries serving fresh croissants, pain au chocolat, and espresso, making for a great start to each day of our bikepacking trip. Camping I was pleasantly surprised by the many well-kept campsites in Provence. We easily found great spots to set up our tents and sometimes even had the option to order fresh bread and pastries for the morning. Two of my favourite campsites for their location are: Huttopia Lac de Serre Pon\u00e7on Les Framboiseilles Alpes-de-Haute-Provence For the last two days of our bikepacking trip, we moved from Parc naturel r\u00e9gional du Verdon to Hautes-Alpes. During this leg of our journey, we enjoyed a two-day stay at the stunning campsite on Lac de Serre-Pon\u00e7on. We left our tents and heavy bags at the campsite while we embarked on challenging rides up the famous Tour de France climbs, Col de Vars and Col d\u2019Izoard. Col de Vars Located on the famous Route des Grandes Alpes , the Col de Vars was a perfect end to our bikepacking trip in France. With a length of 20 kilometres from Guillestre, it gets you to an altitude of 2108m. The Col de Vars is part of the history of the Tour de France. It has been crossed 35 times by the Grande Boucle since the first passage in 1922. Col d\u2019Izoard The climb reaches an altitude of 2360m, which is one of the highest points in the French Alps. It\u2019s a 31.5km ascent from Guillestre with an average gradient of 4.8%. The Col d\u2019Izoard is famous in the Tour de France, often categorized as an HC climb. The stunning La Casse D\u00e9serte landscape on this climb is iconic, making you feel like you\u2019ve cycled to another planet when you reach this part of the ascent. Bikepacking Setup Bike The bike model is a Canyon Grizl AL 6 with 45mm wide tyres. Bags: 16.5L Ortlieb seatpack - I had all my camping gear and off-bike clothes there. You can fit some baguettes on top of it! 11L Ortlieb QR handlebar bag - I stored there my cycling clothes, warm and waterproof layers, and a camera in case of rain. 4.5L frame bag - I stored the bike repair kit and toothbrush, soap, etc. 2 x 5L fork bags - I was able to fit my tent and some random stuff there. The tent poles were strapped to a fork as well. 1L Apidura top tube bag - I love it for its magnetic rivets to quickly access important stuff. I kept my phone and documents there. 2 x 1L snack packs - One to hold the telephoto lens, the other to carry a bottle of wine when needed. Gear Camping Tent: Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2. At ~1400g with its packable size, this tent has been accompanying me on bikepacking trips for the past few years. Sleeping Bag: Cumulus 0\u00b0C comfort. It weighs 850g. It\u2019s a bit bulky, but I prefer to be a bit too warm rather than too cold at night. It fits well into the seat pack. Other camping gear: Stuff from Decathlon with a good price-to-weight ratio. Photo Fujifilm X-S10 (465g) Fujinon 18-55mm F/2.8-4 is not the sharpest lens, but at 310 g, it has a good performance-to-weight ratio. Fujinon 70-300mm F/4-5.6, my all-time favourite lens, has great sharpness and a decent focal length range at a weight of 580g. Actually, I like the fact that the lens is made out of quality plastic rather than metal because it makes it lighter. Mini-tripod for night shots: the ballhead taken from a regular tripod was the heaviest part. DIY 3-point camera strap compatible with peak design quick-release anchor links, tailored for cycling with a camera on my back. Chain Waxing and Bikepacking I\u2019ve been waxing the chain on my road bike for almost a year, and I\u2019m convinced that this is the ultimate method to keep your chain clean and efficient. Also, according to Zero Friction Cycling , the world\u2019s most referenced independent test facility for lubricant and chain performance, wax is not only the most efficient lube but also the cheapest lubricant per km. In the long run, when taking into consideration the cost of replacing worn chains, cassettes, and chainrings, wax is cheaper as it extends the lifetime of the drivetrain . Cleaning a waxed chain is an easy and environmentally friendly process, as all you need is boiling water instead of heavy degreasers or mineral spirits. A big plus when you live in an apartment. It can sound too good to be true up to this point, so I want to mention the downsides of waxed chains. One issue is its limited rust resistance in wet conditions. The chain has to be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent rust. It\u2019s also recommended to re-wax it after every wet, muddy ride. Another issue is the mileage you get from each hot waxing. I was able to consistently get around 300km out of my 12-speed Ultegra on my road bike with a waxed chain before it started squeaking. 300km is not nearly enough for any bikepacking trip, and re-waxing during the trip or carrying extra waxed chains was not worth the hassle for me. With all this in mind, I decided to use this trip as a testing ground. To keep my chain rust-free and dry, I packed a microfiber cloth to clean the chain after each wet ride. To overcome the mileage issue, I took Squirt , a wax-based lube that you can apply directly to the chain. I was planning to start using Squirt later in the trip, once the wax wears out from my chain. Results I was positively surprised by the rust resistance of pure wax. My chain was tested during two wet days of cycling and a full night of torrential rain. I didn\u2019t notice any issues with rust; the chain looked pretty clean, even after cycling in muddy conditions. Squirt Lube worked OK. It kept my drivetrain quiet and efficient but not very clean. I followed the instructions when it came to making sure that the wax-based lube dried on the chain before starting the ride. Unfortunately, it still collected quite a lot of dirt. It surprised me given that on those days we rode 100% on the tarmac. When it came to cleaning the chain after the trip, hot water wasn\u2019t enough, and I had to use mineral spirits before hot waxing it again. The attraction to dirt and the cleaning process make me believe that there is some oily ingredient in Squirt (perhaps paraffin oil). Verdict The setup of waxed chain, microfiber cloth, and wax-based lubricant works well for bikepacking, and I will be using this in the future. Next time, I\u2019m tempted to try other wax-based lubricants that can potentially keep my chain cleaner.

Refer to my favourite routes to hit the road and get some safe, solo miles in and cycle during the coronavirus lockdown. First thing I did after moving in to London was getting a proper road bike and I would recommend it to anyone. Places like Richmond Park or Regent\u2019s park are thriving with the cycling culture on every weekend. Moreover, cycling is a great option for the everyday commute and it allows you to explore London and the neighbouring towns. Here is a list of my favourite places for cycling after living 4 years in London. Early Saturday morning in Roehampton Gate cafe in Richmond Park. Disclaimer: This photo was taken in Fall 2019, cycling in Richmond is forbidden as of now because of COVID. Short routes Richmond park loops A short ride out from the centre, the city\u2019s most popular spot for a few hours of training \u2014 even some of the cycling stars, including Fabien Cancellara, have been known to ride here. At any time you can see cyclists lapping the perimeter road, a circuit of about 12km with two climbs. And on Saturday mornings overenthusiastic local club members form huge pelotons and race around, full of Tour de France delusions, barking at anyone who gets in their way. Strava activity Regent\u2019s park loops Regent\u2019s Park\u2019s central location makes it handy for a quick spin in the city. The road around the outer edge is 4.5km long, perfectly flat and fairly light on traffic, so it\u2019s largely cycle-friendly and you\u2019ll find a lot of other riders and runners here. Don\u2019t jump red lights when you train there. Strava activity Longer routes London to Windsor A flat and fast route from Richmond Park out to Royal Windsor. The profile is pancake flat, so it\u2019s perfect if you\u2019re looking for a longer ride without the hills. The return leg is shorter and faster, so you\u2019ll be home in no time. I was recommended to stop by at Cinnamon Caf\u00e9 to try their cinnamon buns but unfortunatetly it was closed due to the coronavirus. Strava activity London to Box Hill South West London and Surrey are famous when it comes to cycling. The 2012 olympic road race, and the Prudential Ride London route that followed, have firmly put Surrey on the cycling map. Starting in Richmond Park, this route heads out into the Surrey Hills and to the famous Box Hill, a (not so) steep climb of 2.5km and 129m elevation gain. According to Strava\u2019s leaderboard for the Box Hill climb there are more than 120,000 attempts recorded on the app, with the best time of just under 5 minutes. Box Hill climb. Picture thanks to Cycling Weekly . This is my favourite bike ride so far. The route I followed goes through Richmond, Bushy Park and then follows to Surrey Hills through quiet and cycling friendly roads. The return leg, after Box Hill, is not as nice with more busy roads. Strava activity London to \u2026 Brighton (and Seven Sisters) From the city, through the suburbs and into the countryside, with the testing climb of Ditchling Beacon just before the beach below, the London to Brighton route is full of action and should be around 100km from the center of London. If you are looking for more adventures you can add some miles by cycling to Seven Sisters cliffs and back. You can come back to London by bike or take a train back, I recommend the latter. You can refer to this GPX trace on Strava for a route to Brighton and this trace for the route to Seven Sisters cliffs from Brighton. Direct route to the coastline through a sheep pasture > muddy road. Seven Sister cliffs and English Channel. Oxford Cycling from London to Oxford can be cumbersome, since there no signle best route there. You need to trade off going fast on busy roads and going slower on quiet roads with bad asphalt (not recommended for a road bike). I followed a 120km route similar to this one but I needed to check maps often as many intersections lacked signs. If you have more sturdy bike you might consider following the Thames Valley bike route . My friend Szymon and I decided to cycle to Oxford just to try Moo-Moo\u2019s milkshakes , so don\u2019t forget to give it a go once you reach the city. I recommend going back to London by train. Looking for more routes? For those who want to explore even more routes I strongly recommend Strava\u2019s Local Guide for London and Dirty Wkd London routes . You can find there GPX trace with a detailed descriptions of the routes. \u2190Sussex Coastal Marathon Bikepacking & wild camping in Sweden\u2192 Jedr's Blog Blog by Jedr Blaszyk .Tech, cycling, photography & travelling.

It\u2019s a destination unlike any other in Europe. Its unique landscapes, smouldering volcanoes and blue glaciers complement the modern lifestyle and especially the coffee culture of the capital city of Reykjavik. Car rental The most convenient way to get around the country is to rent a car. There are two options to consider, either a regular 2WD or a 4x4 car suitable for driving on highland gravel roads, called F-roads. We opted for the latter and on many occasions, it proved to be an absolute necessity for us to get to our planned destinations. One thing to note, most 4x4 rentals don\u2019t have insurance for river crossings - which are not as uncommon as it sounds on F-roads. Even with an off-road car, we avoided river crossings, as we witnessed others flooding their cars. I snapped a photo (it\u2019s at the end of this post) of the rescue team preparing to get a car out of the river. It\u2019s recommended to check current road conditions on road.is . Camping Camping is an ideal way to immerse yourself in Icelandic nature. It\u2019s also cheaper and more available than sparsely scattered hotels and guesthouses. Since we had the gear we opted for sleeping in a tent rather than a car. We took a lightweight three-season tent, (very) warm sleeping bags (0\u00b0C and -20\u00b0C comfort) and lots of warm and waterproof clothes. In the summer months, the sun never fully sets, so we could always pitch the tent in daylight. Between June and August the mean temperature is at its peak. It doesn\u2019t mean there is much sunlight. The weather during our stay was fairly cloudy with 2 \u201csunny\u201d days, a bit of rain, and a few fairly cold nights (around 5\u00b0C). 8 Day Roadtrip We stayed in Iceland for 8 days. We decided not to go 1,400km along the famous ring road, as we didn\u2019t have enough time to see all the sights on the way. Also, following the ring road means staying on the tarmac all the time. Since we had a 4x4 car we wanted to enjoy highland gravel roads. We decided to focus initially on the western and then southern parts of Iceland. On our way back to Reykjavik we followed F-roads through the Fjallabak Nature Reserve and Landmannalaugar - the most scenic part of our road trip. Roadtrip Itinerary Day 1: Ride to Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula Day 2: Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula Day 3: Golden Circle Day 4: Foss Day Day 5: Glacier Day Day 6: F-Roads Day Day 7: Reykjavik and Chill Day 8: Reykjanes Volcano and Airport Day 1: Ride to Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula We landed at Keflavik airport in the afternoon and picked up our car from IcePol - a local car rental company (we had a great experience). There, we also rented some camping gear: a folding table and chairs, cutlery and a gas stove - so we could have a proper morning coffee. Car pickup proceeded smoothly and soon after landing we were already in the car driving towards Sn\u00e6fellsnes Penninsula. Passing by Reykjavik, we stopped by a big store to buy food for the next few days. On the way, we stopped by Ger\u00f0uberg Cliffs and Bjarnarfoss. After a few hours, we arrived at Hellissandur Camping. It was a nice campsite to spend the night on with suitable grounds for pitching a tent. Day 2: Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula We explored Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula by following a rocky road to Skar\u00f0sv\u00edk Beach and Sv\u00f6rtuloft Lighthouse. Then we got to the main road which took us to a Hellnar View Point with Fj\u00f6ruh\u00fasi\u00f0 caf\u00e9 nearby. They offer great coffee and delicious fish soup. Highly recommended. We also walked around Kirkjufell Mountain - known as Arrowhead Mountain from Game of Thrones. On the way to our next campsite, we stopped at Landbrotalaug Hot Spring. It was empty when we arrived. We spent the night at Mosskogar Camping - an excellent outpost for starting the Golden Circle tour the following day. Day 3: Golden Circle The Golden Circle follows the \u201cmust-see\u201d Iceland tourist destinations. It includes \u00deingvellir National Park located in a rift valley created by the drifting apart of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. You can view the plates\u2019 edges when walking around the park. The next stop is at Geysir park, where the Great Geysir erupts every 10 minutes. Another landmark on the way is Gullfoss, a huge waterfall, definitely worth seeing. We also jumped into Kualaug hot spring, which was muddy and small, but warm. We camped at Camping Flj\u00f3tshli\u00f0 which is located on the way to waterfalls and glaciers. Day 4: Foss Day Foss is the Icelandic word for waterfall, so on a Foss day, we\u2019ve seen many beautiful waterfalls. We visited Gluggafoss, Seljalandsfoss (there is a path leading \u201cinside\u201d) and Sk\u00f3gafoss (a great location for photos). We also hiked to Seljavallalaug Pool to relax in the warm water from a local hot spring. It\u2019s an outdoor swimming pool located in the mountains, built in 1923 by a local who wanted to teach kids how to swim. Nowadays, it\u2019s open to everybody willing to hike up the mountains to jump into the pool. We ended our day with a hike to the Solheimasandur Plane Wreck. However, I don\u2019t think taking a photo is worth walking there and back for 1.5 hours. We spent our 4th night in \u00deakgil camping, located high up in Katla geopark, on Katla volcano - one of Iceland\u2019s largest and most active volcanoes. It\u2019s located near Vik city. The road leading there requires a 4x4 car and is one of the most scenic routes we\u2019ve driven in Iceland. The campsite is situated in a valley with many hiking trails around the geopark. Day 5: Glacier Day My favourite part of the trip started that day. First we needed to leave the campsite, driving down rough gravel roads to Vik. Then we headed south-east towards one of Europe\u2019s biggest glaciers. On the way, we stopped by a beautiful foss: Svartifoss which is surrounded by hexagonal basalt columns. Their geometric shape is the result of physical processes occurring inside a lava flow during a cool-down. The main attractions of the day were glacier lagoons, whose still blue waters were dotted with icebergs from the surrounding glaciers. We\u2019ve also had a very pleasant chat with a bike-packer - Chris Hankey - who is spending two months this summer cycling around Iceland. Day 6: F-Roads Day Not driving on F-roads with a 4x4 rental is a sin. We spent this whole day driving on a rocky road to Landmannalaugar located in Fjallabak Nature Reserve - known for its natural geothermal hot springs and surrounding landscape - my favourite, the most picturesque spot of the trip. Day 7: Reykjavik and Chill We took it slow, spent some time in Reykjavik - tried the famous hot dogs and got delicious coffee at Reykjavik Roasters cafe. Then we indulged ourselves with the 7 Step Icelandic Ritual in the Sky Lagoon - located just outside the capital city. Day 8: Reykjanes Volcano and Airport It was a short day. We only had time for a hike to the Fagradalsfjall volcano, which erupted in 2021. We could still see fumes coming out of cooling lava. (Un)fortunately there were no active volcanic eruptions during our stay, so seeing red, hot, flowing lava was impossible. Useful Resources Hot Springs Map - useful map with plenty of hot springs locations. Campsites Map - absolute must when camping, includes all campsites in Iceland, has useful info like prices, whether they accept debit cards or what amenities are available. Much better than Google Maps! road.is - important website with current road conditions.

Here is a quick recap of key points: The Lucene index is built using an inverted index, a data structure that maps terms to their corresponding documents. In an inverted index, each term is associated with a list of documents that contain that term. This allows for fast lookups of documents that match a given term or set of terms. The index is split into index segments, which contain a subset of documents, to allow for more efficient searching and a reduction in memory requirements. Segments are never modified in-place, so they can be cached easily by the filesystem. Segments can be searched concurrently lock-free, with no risk of race conditions. It also allows concurrent query execution. It is not just about inverted indexes in Lucene. For example, doc values are a columnar data structure that stores the values of a field for each document in the index. It allows for fast lookups of field values without having to load the entire document - useful for efficient sorting and faceting. Now let\u2019s focus on what factors enable Lucene to be so effective at search and ranking, and how its design makes it suitable to run at scale. But let\u2019s not forget that the true value of Lucene is its community - hundreds of developers who have committed to the project since it was open-sourced in 2001. Efficient search Index data structures One of the key reasons for Lucene\u2019s performance is its efficient use of data structures. Inverted index and doc values are effective for fast lookups for different query types, while index segments ensure efficient resource consumption and concurrent read access for queries. There are still more \u201ctricks\u201d that Lucene uses to optimize query performance. Bitsets are used in Lucene to represent sets of documents that match a particular query. Bitsets use one bit to represent the presence or absence of a document in the set, which makes them very compact and efficient to use. Bitsets can also be applied to perform Boolean operations on sets of documents. For example, Lucene can leverage bitsets to efficiently perform OR, AND, and NOT operations, allowing complex queries to be executed quickly and efficiently. Moreover, bitsets are used to handle delete operations - documents in the segment as marked as deleted deleted - until the documents are actually removed during the segment merge. Caches help to improve Lucene\u2019s search performance. The field cache is used to cache field values across multiple documents, while the filter cache is used to cache the results of expensive filters. Filter caches are encoded as bitsets to determine which document match the filter. The query cache is used to cache the results of previously executed queries. If a subsequent query is found to be identical to a previously executed query, the cached result can be returned instead of executing the query again. Lucene also uses finite-state transducers (FSTs) - they are compact and efficient data structures that allow for fast lookups of key-value pairs. It\u2019s used for features like auto-suggest and spell-checking - Lucene uses the FST to efficiently look up all possible completions of the partially typed, or misspelled query. FSTs provide fast lookups of term frequencies, prefixes and other metadata associated with each term, useful in a variety of search-related operations. More about this data structure can be read in: Using Finite State Transducers in Lucene . Block trees are used to represent the posting list - a set of doc ids and offsets associated with each term in an inverted index. By compressing the posting lists, Lucene can reduce the amount of disk I/O required to access the posting lists during search operations. This can result in significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large indexes. Block trees are also used to implement skip lists, which allow for fast skipping over irrelevant documents during search operations. Skip lists are used to quickly navigate the posting lists associated with each term in a search index, allowing for fast identification of relevant documents. Query Types Lucene\u2019s extensive support for different query types allows its community to build sophisticated search applications that can handle a wide range of use cases. Lucene query types are modular, therefore making it possible to combine different queries to create more complex search queries. Here are some commonly used Lucene query types. Query Role Term Query matches documents that contain a specific term Phrase Query matches documents that contain a specific sequence of terms in order Boolean Query allows for the combination of multiple queries using boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT Fuzzy Query matches documents that contain similar terms to a specified term Wildcard Query matches documents that contain terms that match a specified pattern Range Query matches documents that contain terms within a specified range Prefix Query matches documents that contain terms that begin with a specified prefix Multi-term Query matches documents that contain multiple terms Boost Query allows for the boosting of certain queries to give them more weight in the search results Let\u2019s look at an example query. Assume you have a set of bikepacking blog posts - all indexed in Lucene so that they can be easily searchable. If you are looking for an adventure in Norway, where the distance covered is between 300 and 800km, you can construct the following Lucene query: ( title:bikepacking norway ^ 2 OR content:bikepacking norway ) AND distance: [ 300 TO 800 ] This query searches for documents that meet the following criteria (Boolean query with subqueries joined by AND and OR operators): must contain the term \"bikepacking norway\" in either the title or the content field (Multi-term query). The boost operator ^ is used to boost the score of documents that contain the term in the title field (Boost query) must have a distance between 300 and 800 (Range query) Concurrent query execution The concurrency model for a Lucene application is one thread per query at search time, but it\u2019s also possible to execute a single query concurrently using multiple threads to greatly reduce the time of the slowest queries. A Lucene index is segmented, which makes searching it an embarrassingly parallel problem: each query must visit all segments in the index, collecting their globally competitive hits. When the query is single-threaded, that one query thread must visit all segments sequentially. If the index is large, and the queries are costly, those queries will require high CPU cost and wall clock time to find the top hits. When a query is run in multi-threaded mode, the segments in the index are first grouped up front into single thread work units called thread slices. By default, large segments belong to their own thread slice and smaller segments will be put together into a single thread slice, since they are presumably quick to search sequentially by a single thread. But, even though searching a Lucene index is a naturally and embarrassingly parallel problem, using multiple threads for one query incurs an inherent coordination overhead. Concurrent query execution feature is still missing from popular search engines based on Lucene like Elasticsearch, but it\u2019s supported in nrtsearch . Document scoring Lucene scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given document is to a user\u2019s query. In general, the idea behind the VSM is that the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the query specification. The BM25 algorithm - which stands for \u201cBest Match 25\u201d - is a variant of the Vector Space Model that takes into account document length and term frequency. It is used in Lucene as a default scoring VSM. The algorithm calculates a relevance score for each document based on the following formula: score ( q , d ) = sum ( weight ( t , d ) * weight ( t , q ) ) where score(q, d) is the relevance score for the document d with respect to the query q , weight(t, d) is the weight of the term t in the document d , and weight(t, q) is the weight of the term t in the query q . The weights are a function of: term t frequency in document d , total number of documents containing term t and total number of docs in the index, length of the document d and the average document length in the index, tuning parameters that control the effect of term frequency and document length on the relevance score. Custom similarity scoring While the BM25 algorithm works well for many search use cases, it may not be suitable for all applications. In some cases, you may need to customize the similarity scoring algorithm to better match the specific needs of your application. Such cases include: Domain-specific ranking factors - different search applications may have different ranking factors that are important for relevance Personalization - user-specific features and signals, such as the user\u2019s preferences or search history, can be incorporated into the search results to provide more personalized and relevant results Lucene supports defining custom Similarity scorers - it can be a custom algorithm or a continuously retrained ML model. All you need to do then is specify your custom scorer class in the search query. public class CustomSimilarity extends Similarity { public float score ( BasicStats stats , float freq , float docLen ) { float score = . . . // your magic code return score ; } } The document scoring mechanism allows Lucene to return highly relevant search results, given a user query, even in large and complex index. In the next post, Exploring Apache Lucene - Part 3: Running at Scale , I will investigate different architectures that make it possible to run Apache Lucene at scale. \u2190The Tech Stack of Fast, Free, and Customizable Blog Nrtsearch Tutorial - Indexing Web Content for Search\u2192 Jedr's Blog \u2022 Tech Blog Blog by Jedr Blaszyk .Tech, cycling, photography & travelling.

While developers often focus on speedy searches, they tend to overlook the aspect of data indexing. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that easy-to-manage data ingestion is a key foundation for successful data-driven solutions. Elasticsearch (ES) has many ingestion tools, but sometimes they don\u2019t fit all data sources. That\u2019s where Elastic Data Connectors come in. They let you easily link custom or proprietry data to Elasticsearch. This framework is lightweight, open-source and flexible, and works both on-premise and in the cloud. In short, it\u2019s a straightforward way to keep any content source, e.g. database, cloud storage or local file system, in sync with a search-optimized Elasticsearch index. Other ingestion solutions offered by the Enterprise Search component in the Elastic stack are Web Crawler and Index API . Data Connectors Framework elastic/connectors The data connectors framework makes it easier for developers to create connector clients that can sync data from other sources into Elasticsearch. The framework takes care of essential tasks like scheduling data syncs, extracting text from files, and setting up index mappings automatically. This way, developers can concentrate on integrating their chosen data source without worrying about these common tasks. The data connectors framework can be configured to use Elasticsearch\u2019s ingestion pipelines to perform transformations on data before storing it in an index. A common use case is document enrichment with machine learning . For example, you can: analyze text fields using a Text embedding model that will generate a dense vector representation of your data run text classification for sentiment analysis extract key information from text with Named Entitiy Recogintion (NER) Architecture The data connectors framework is deployed as a separate stateless service. You can host them yourself, or for selected native connectors run them in the Elastic Cloud natively. The framework connects your third-party data source with an Elasticsearch index and keeps it in sync, so that you can focus on search and analytics with your data. Connector Protocol Connectors framework relies on the Connector Protocol . All communication between connectors and other parts of the stack happens asynchronously through an Elasticsearch index. This comes with several benefits. Stateless deployment : The data connectors service relies on external state in an ES index Fault-tolerance : The service can resume operation on a different host after a restart or a failure. Once it reestablishes connection with Elasticsearch, it will continue its normal operation. Developers have control over a deployment - This service can be easily self-hosted or run in the Elastic cloud. It only needs to be able to discover your Elasticsearch instance over the network. This setup is developer friendly and aims to make connectors service easy to deploy and manage. The framework is written in async python making this IO-bound framework lightweight, fast and efficient. Available connectors Currently, the following content sources are supported as of version 8.11 . For an up-to-date list of supported connectors check the official documentation .

Custom connectors You are not limited to the connectors included in the data connectors framework. It is easy to implement a custom data connector using the abstractions provided by the framework. All you need to do is define a custom DataSource class in async python and the framework will take care of making it compatible with common functionalities, such as scheduling data syncs, extracting text from files, and setting up index mappings automatically. Here is an example starting point for implementing MyCustomDataSource . In order to turn this into a functional connector you need to define get_default_configuration , ping and get_docs methods. class MyCustomDataSource ( BaseDataSource ) : \"\"\"Connector to my custom data source\"\"\" name = \"Custom Source\" service_type = \"custom_source\" @classmethod def get_default_configuration ( cls ) : \"\"\"Returns a dict with a default configuration\"\"\" raise NotImplementedError async def ping ( self ) : \"\"\"When called, pings the backend If the backend has an issue, raises an exception \"\"\" raise NotImplementedError async def get_docs ( self , filtering = None ) : \"\"\"Returns an iterator on all documents present in the backend Each document is a tuple with: - a mapping with the data to index - a coroutine to download extra data (attachments) The mapping should have least an `id` field and optionally a `timestamp` field in ISO 8601 UTC The coroutine is called if the document needs to be synced and has attachments. It needs to return a mapping to index. It has two arguments: doit and timestamp If doit is False, it should return None immediately. If timestamp is provided, it should be used in the mapping. Example: async def get_file(doit=True, timestamp=None): if not doit: return return {'TEXT': 'DATA', 'timestamp': timestamp, 'id': 'doc-id'} \"\"\" raise NotImplementedError To learn more about how to write a custom connector, refer to the How to create customized connectors for Elasticsearch blog post or check the implementation of existing connectors . You can use Customized connector to configure and run your custom connector from Kibana. Navigate to: Search > Indices > Create a new index > Connector > Customized connector . If you want to contribute your custom connector to the open-source connectors framework, refer to the How to contribute connectors guide in the connectors repository. \u2190Exploring Apache Lucene - Part 3: Running at Scale Jedr's Blog \u2022 Tech Blog Blog by Jedr Blaszyk .Tech, cycling, photography & travelling.

After an 18-hour cruise, our Swedish bike packing adventure began. We cycled along EuroVelo 10 - the Baltic Sea Cycle Route. It follows endless tarmac and gravel roads along the Baltic Sea. The Swedish coastline includes beaches, cliffs, woodland, ports and marinas as well as countless large and small islands - dream scenery for bikepackers. On this journey, we\u2019ve lost count of how many times we stopped to swim in the warm summer lakes and cold Baltic Sea. Also, with Allemansr\u00e4tt, a Swedish law that allows everyone to roam and camp where they please, we were spoilt with campsite choices. Quite a few times friendly locals helped us find camping spots. Route EuroVelo 10 We followed the EuroVelo 10 - Baltic Sea Cycle Route, southwards from Stockholm, the country\u2019s vibrant capital, to Malm\u00f6, mostly along the sea. We cycled from Stockholm (Nyn\u00e4shamn port) to Ystad, the point of departure for our ferry back home. The bikepacking journey took 8 days. We averaged 115km a day. The route was hilly with many short up- and downhills. For the first 4 days we averaged more than 1000m elevation gain per day. It was quite straining especially when cycling on a fully loaded bike - we carried around 20kg of equipment and supplies. The route became flatter and easier as we approached Kalmar and Karlskrona. The wind was not a big problem as for the majority of the route we were riding covered by trees. A gravel bike is advisible as much of the route leads along gravel and tarmac roads. 35mm-42mm tyres worked great for us. Route Stats Baltic Sea Cycle Route Distance: 895km Elevation: 5900m Time: 8 days Date: Jul 2020 Wild Camping \u201cThe Everyman\u2019s Right\u201d in Sweden allows people to camp anywhere in the wilderness as long as it is not private property. It makes bikepacking affordable in an otherwise expensive country. We camped in a wild camp for 8 days, usually very close to the Baltic sea or some lake. You trade views and proximity to Swedish nature for utilities like showers or toilets. Swimming in lakes and having access to the bathroom at gas stations can make up for all the pain. Wilderness Shelters Sweden also offers a wide variety wilderness shelters throughout the country. It is possible to spend the night there for free. Usually, you will an open fireplace, tables and benches. Local people told us it was fine to set up a tent next to the hut. On a cold, windy night the hut might not be enough to protect you from the wind. Photo gallery Check out all, high-resolution photos from the trip.

Having lived in different cities: London, San Francisco, Hamburg, and now Pozna\u0144, I always found bikes to be a green, healthy, and efficient way to get around the city for day-to-day commutes and weekend trips. As cities face congestion and environmental challenges, the push for sustainable transportation intensifies. Bicycles, with their low carbon footprint and efficiency, are emerging as pivotal tools in this shift. They not only combat climate issues but also promote healthier and more connected urban communities. Bikes can be a big part of the evolution of our cities. They\u2019re key for sustainable urban travel. And if we\u2019re talking about limiting the use of cars - cargo bikes might just be the answer. Sustainable urban mobility Sustainable urban mobility is all about making our city transport systems more efficient, environmentally friendly, and accessible for everyone. It is a way to move people and goods around in cities without causing unnecessary pollution, traffic congestion, or straining natural resources. For me, it\u2019s all about finding a balance where cities can grow and prosper without sacrificing the environment or quality of life in the process. Cargo bikes Cargo bikes come into the picture as a cool solution to some of these problems. They are designed with extended frames housing a customizable cargo area, which makes them good at carrying goods, kids, pets, and more. They are versatile and adaptable to the user\u2019s needs. Cargo bikes are a viable alternative to cars and vans clogging up the city streets. They can enable delivering packages in last-mile logistics, and they\u2019re also fantastic for family daily tasks. Many parents have adopted cargo bikes as a green and fun way to transport their kids to school. Plus, when looking to catch some fresh air over the weekend, they\u2019re great for taking the kids or even the family dog on a ride, perhaps to a nearby lake. Cargo bikes produce zero emissions, navigate congested streets way better, and require less space to park. So, instead of idling engines in traffic jams, maybe these eco-friendly bikes can be doing the same job but in a cleaner and more efficient way, effectively allowing for the replacement of cars in many cases. Why should you use a cargo bike? Here\u2019s why I think we will soon see many more cargo bikes on our streets. They are: Eco-friendly - Cargo bikes can drastically reduce the carbon footprint of our urban travels. Also, they don\u2019t produce emissions, which contributes to better air quality in our cities. Economical - Cargo bike maintenance costs are next to nothing when compared with cars. With rising costs of living, they help you save on fuel costs, parking fees, and public transportation tickets. Fast - They can help you avoid wasting precious time in traffic jams. Tracking data suggests that the average speed of a cargo bike in densely populated urban areas in Poland averaged 20km/h - that\u2019s probably the same as a car during rush hours. Customizable - With wide range of accessories, you can adapt the bike to your needs. They can be great for transporting groceries, kids, pets, or even last-mile logistics. Healthy - Regular biking is beneficial for your cardiovascular health, and you get those feel-good endorphins going. Hazay - cargo bikes made in Poland Hazay is a cargo bike manufacturer from my hometown - Pozna\u0144. Their electric cargo bikes are 100% designed and manufactured in Poland. They offer two cargo bike models: Hazay Family and Hazay Buddy . They mainly differ in groupset configuration and the finishing of welds. I had a chance to ride their bikes on multiple occasions. Bikes are well-engineered, offering good handling even when the cargo area is loaded. Their rigid frame and a central motor deliver a smooth riding experience. They don\u2019t only manufacture cargo bikes; they also build an ecosystem of accessories that enable eco-friendly and comfortable transport for anyone. Hazay Bikes offers a range of accessories for children ( child seat and rain tent ), dogs ( dog carrier ) and business ( cargo box ). By producing high-quality, efficient, and affordable cargo bikes, Hazay Bikes is paving the way for cities to adopt more sustainable modes of transport. Their focus on creating an ecosystem around the cargo bike demonstrates their commitment to a broader vision \u2013 one where urban environments are less congested, less polluted, and more enjoyable for everyone. \u2190Bikepacking in France - Provence and Hautes-Alpes Work Bike Balance in Calpe\u2192 Jedr's Blog Blog by Jedr Blaszyk .Tech, cycling, photography & travelling.

After all, they do need to fill up the space on your feed with something, in between showing paid ads. Content type matters. Best holiday pictures from? Instagram. A bit more pictures from a bikepacking trip? Flickr. Career move or a success story? Linkedin. Wanna dive deeper into tech? Medium. Sharing something shorter? Twitter. There seems to be no good solution that ticks all of the boxes to share content you want, on your terms. Search engine optimization (SEO) is another issue. Is the stuff we post to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter even searchable? Before going on cycling trips I would usually spend quite a bit of time researching places, campsites and routes worth visiting. I don\u2019t remember seeing any content sourced from big tech apps - search engines will usually rank them pretty low in search results. Medium is an exception - if I happen to be lucky enough not to hit the paywall. Blogs are absolute winners in the SEO category. They are indexable by search engines, searchable and readable for us, with tons of valuable content. Blogs are great sources of information whether I\u2019m researching a tech topic or a bikepacking route. It\u2019s because of my bikepacking trips, that I decided to start a blog. I wanted to tell this story, on my terms, without restrictions on how the content is organized and presented. I wanted my experience and well-researched routes to be discoverable by anyone interested - in order to give back, hopefully, an inspiration, to the community. It\u2019s also a great way to reflect on your experience after doing something interesting. And it worked! Take for example \"norway bikepacking\" search query in Google, you should find the story usually in the top 10 results. Norway Bikepacking: Trondheim to Bergen The content is very important for being ranked highly. But as a techie, I did my research to make sure all non-content related metrics will boost my blog in page rank algorithm: performance, SEO practices and mobile usability. I will go over the tech stack of my blog, and some design decisions which made this performant, customizable and completely free - the only recurring cost is a few dollars for the domain name - and it enabled such results from pagespeed.web.dev - a Google tool to measure overall website performance. Blogging solutions market There are tons of options on the market - try searching for \"blog\" . The choice is hard, especially for someone without much technical experience. Questions I asked myself when researching this topic were: Can I host the blog myself? - I didn\u2019t want to lock myself with a single hosting provider. Will ads be displayed on my blog? - Some blogging providers (e.g. wordpress.com) show ads on your blog by default when on a \u201cfree plan\u201d. How much will it cost? - All the costs related to hosting, themes and customization. How easy is it to customize? - Can I easily use code to customize the blog? I wanted to choose my own hosting provider, customize my blog without having to buy \u201cmagical\u201d plugins and eliminate all ads (without having to be on a paid plan). It also had to be fast - the UX was very important to me. This Blog\u2019s Tech Stack I decided to use GatsbyJS which is an open-source static site generator built on top of Node.js using React and GraphQL. You are able to define your blogging templates in React, while your content is written in MDX - Markdown supporting JSX (React) components, which allows you to add interactive React components directly into your copy written in Markdown, like that one: Check this post\u2019s source to verify that it\u2019s just a React <SliderPicker /> defined in MDX file. The static webpage is hosted completely for free thanks to GitHub Pages. To speed up the website load times, I use Cloudflare (amazing) free plan which offers a content delivery network (CDN) along with caching. This setup, along with built-in Gatsby\u2019s optimizations such as image lazy-loading, is sufficient to score near-perfect scores for website performance on popular benchmarks. Let\u2019s go over the building blocks. GatsbyJS, GraphQL, MDX Gatsby.js is a static site generator that uses React.js (for the client-side) and GraphQL (to access data) to build reliable, fast, static websites. You can use React to define pages or templates (like blog post pages) that query for data using GQL. The GQL queries can fetch your data from CMS (like Contentful) or your local filesystem - e.g. blog posts organized in folders. It might sound a bit complex but if you are familiar with React and GQL, the learning curve is not steep at all. The documentation is great and there are lots of starter templates (check Gatsby Starter Libary ). It allows you to start with having a fully functional Gatsby blog so that you can focus on writing content and customizations. The rough structure of your GatsbyJS blog will look like that: \u251c\u2500\u2500 content \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 blog-post-1 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.mdx \u251c\u2500\u2500 src \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blog-post-template.js \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 blog-index.js \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... other React components / files \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 gatsby-config.js \u2514\u2500\u2500 gatsby-node.js You organize your blog posts as folders inside /content . The folder name can map to your post\u2019s slug so that on path /blog-post-1 you would serve content sourced from Markdown (MDX) file content/blog-post-1/index.mdx . The content will be displayed inside a template you defined in React - in our case blog-post-template.js and your blog index (main) page will be defined in blog-index.js . In gatsby-config.js you would need to use a few open-source (and free plugins!), like gatsby-source-filesystem , to use GQL queries to fetch blog post content from your local filesystem. The GQL for e.g. blog post is defined directly in your js template file and looks roughly like this: query BlogPostBySlug ( $slug : String ! ) { mdx ( fields : { slug : { eq : $slug } } ) { id body timeToRead ... # more fields, e.g. images fields { slug } } } Your blog content written in Markdown can be easily rendered inside React post templates. But using Markdown can be quite limiting as it is pretty basic when it comes to layout and customizations. MDX comes to the rescue! It allows you to add JSX (React) components directly into your posts written in Markdown, just like that: import { BlockPicker } from \"react-color\" _Hello, world!_ Here's a color picker! <BlockPicker /> Hello, world! Here\u2019s a color picker! #ffa500 When using Gatsby performance is baked in as it automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure your blog is fast \u2014 from my experience, no manual tuning is required to ace the benchmarks. As you can see Gatsby, GQL and MDX are powerful tools to build customizable, interactive and performant static blogs. Github Pages Github Pages allows you to host static websites directly on Github. It\u2019s free for public repos. All you need to do is to generate your static website and push the code into a branch, gh-pages npm package will help you with automating this process. Once the generated site is pushed to the branch, Github Actions will take it from there and deploy the static website under your domain name. Cloudflare CDN CloudFlare is an awesome reverse cache proxy and CDN that provides DNS and HTTPS. Once you add your static site make sure to enable Cloudflare to cache it - and effectively serve it from CDN Edge Cache - this should visibly speed up the load times. Whenever you make a change to your site you would need to remember to manually purge the cache in Cloudflare (it probably can be automated using Github Actions). Developing and Deploying the Blog Running locally For local dev Gatsby offers a hot-reloading development environment, just run gatsby develop . Once I\u2019m happy with my changes I would usually run the production build and serve it locally to double-check that everything is generated correctly, you can do it via: gatsby build && gatsby serve I found that sometimes the develop server is not 100% consistent with production builds when it comes to CSS styling - all issues were related to Chrome, Safari, etc. default styles being overwritten by develop server, but for prod build the default styles were taking precedence (e.g. extra margin under <p> tags). Though I didn\u2019t have that issue for a long time, perhaps upgrading Gatsby fixed it. Deploying changes Once I\u2019m happy with the results, I do the following: Run yarn deploy what maps to yarn build && gh-pages -d public , the generated static website from the build folder will be pushed to github branch. Github Actions will start a deployment process, it can take a while until the process finishes. After that\u2019s done I go to Cloudflare to purge the cache. That\u2019s all! You can optionally go to Google Search Console (SEO tool) and tell it directly to index your newly created blog post - so that it can appear in search results ASAP. Limitations The blog is static - it means it\u2019s fast but also it means there is no server able to serve dynamic content. User accounts, reactions, comments - they are not natively supported by Gatsby - but there are ways for SSR with Gatsby . Also, there are many (freemium and paid) solutions on the market which at least allow you to embed reactions and comments. I store images directly in the repo, they are also included in the static build. This will work until I don\u2019t hit GitHub repo size limit (afaik it\u2019s 100GB). I optimize, and downsize all the images so for now it works fine. But if you are planning on storing a lot of images you can use any image CMS/CDN provider and integrate it with Gatsby directly - read more about it here . The developer is in the driver\u2019s seat, meaning I can customize the blog as I wish but I\u2019m also responsible for all housekeeping stuff e.g. adding SEO meta tags for search engines. Gatsby won\u2019t complain if you forget add title and description tags (very important for SEO) - so in that respect, I find WordPress much easier and safer to use - it by nature works well with search engines by asking you to provide important meta tags.

Our hike around the Isle of Wight was planned well in advance. Therefore, I was not expecting a message from Georgios, a few days before the hike, saying that his friend would be more than happy to give us a \u201clift\u201d to the Isle of Wight\u2019s Bembridge airport and have lunch with us there. Redhill airport Our trip started at Redhill airport, a small airport near London with an all-grass runway. The plane was already waiting for us in front of a hangar. We left hiking equipment in the cabin and our pilot, Theo, led us to the pre-departure briefing. The pre-flight tasks included checking the weather, planning the route, contacting the destination airport about our scheduled arrival, and checking for airspace closures due to the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. All of that worked smoothly and I thought we were good to go. The issues began when we figured out the mass distribution, and our estimated takeoff and landing weight. The plane was marginally within the limits. Also, when checking manually, the extended-range fuel tanks had more fuel than what was reported in the aircraft logbook - the reason being that the fuel indicator displayed a maximum of 13 gallons, but the long-range tanks on our aircraft had 19 gallons capacity. After long 2 hours of talking to the air club members, it was agreed to take out all the unnecessary cargo from the plane (including extra weight to balance the plane when flying solo). We checked that we were within the limits, and finally our pilot, Theo, gave the go-ahead for takeoff. Flying to Bembridge The weather was favourable for flying. It was sunny with a bit of cloud and clear visibility. After taking off we quickly reached Eastbourne and then turned west towards Brighton. The clouds stayed away from the sea due to the temperature difference. Flying along the coast we enjoyed the pleasant cloudless conditions and a stunning view. We did some sharp turns, dives and climbs to feel the G-force. The most exciting part was when I got the controls and steered the plane for a bit for the first time in my life. This was a remarkable experience. We reached Bembridge airport on the Isle of Wight after 45 minutes in the air. Just before landing, our pilot took a long turn offering us a breathtaking view of the island. We landed smoothly and parked the plane on the airfield next to many other small planes of people who flew into Bembridge for the weekend to relax. The pub was next to the airport. We had the famed ribs for lunch, while other planes landed and took off close by. After lunch we parted ways with Theo and began our hike, aiming to reach the Needles in 3 days. Part 2: The Hike Our hike started late in the afternoon after lunch at the Bembridge airport pub. The goal for the day was to reach Luccombe, 10 km from the airport and spend the night wild camping in the forest. After jumping a few fences, we got to the coastal path which circles around the island. After reaching Luccombe, we learned that the path leading to our camping spot was closed due to a landslide. Later in our hike, we could often see cracks in the clay and sand-like cliffs. Often, large land pieces could be seen lying below the cliffs, falling from the top. We set up the tent in some random spot in the forest as it got dark. Isle of Wight AONB On day two of our adventure, we got to the Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding National Beauty (AONB), a substantial piece of land stretching from the southern part of the island to the Needles. One thing we haven\u2019t accounted for is that there are not many places to get food there. We could only find 2 pubs marked on maps near the coastal path. So, our menu for the next 2 days consisted of British ales, fish and chips and other classics. The southwestern part of the island offered amazing views and nature, there was just sea, cliffs and endless fields. We spend the second night at the Paradise Cottage Campsite ran by a very nice old couple. On the 3rd day of our hike, we could already see the faint white-coloured cliffs in front of us, the Needles, the goal of our journey. Initially, we planned to hike for 4 days, but because of the forecasted storm we stretched our 3rd-day hike to 35kms and we managed to get to the Needles for the sunset. Then we ran for the bus which got us to Yarmouth, just in time to catch the last ferry back.

We started in Ystad, cycled through Gothenburg, took a ferry to Frederikshavn, Denmark and closed the loop in Copenhagen. Kattegat Loop Bikepacking Distance: 900km Elevation: 3130m Time: 8 days Date: Jul 2021 Coastal Bike Path Sweden Staying close to the sea meant that the route profile was rather flat with not that many hills. However, at the same time it was windy and the weather could be unpredictable. Starting from Ystad we followed the coastal bike path which led us through Malm\u00f6, Helsingborg, Halmstad and Gothenburg. The bikepacking-friendly \u201cEveryman\u2019s Right\u201d law allowed us to camp in the wild . We used this website to find camping spots. We spent two nights camping close to the sea, waking up to the sound of waves and brewing our morning coffee on the beach. We also camped in the wilderness shelter located at the lake in the forest close to Gothenburg ( map ). he lake water was just perfect for a refreshing evening swim. During the first 3 days of cycling, we covered 440km, averaging almost 150km per day. On the fourth day, we reached Gothenburg where we rested and explored the city. In the afternoon we caught a ferry to Frederikshavn in Denmark. Denmark On the other side of Kattegat, we were hit with harsh weather. It got cold and windy with some rainy days. Unfortunately, wild camping in Denmark is not allowed everywhere so we had to spend two nights in established campsites for a fee. However, there are several designated forests where wild camping is permitted. Here is an excellent map for finding such spots. Danish bike paths led us from Frederikshavn along the coast to Hadsund, Randers and eventually Aarhus. We got our next ferry to Sj\u00e6llands Odde , located about 100km from Copenhagen. Copenhagen Pleasures Our bikepacking adventure concluded in Copenhagen, Denmark\u2019s capital. We took two days to immerse ourselves in the city\u2019s vibrant life. Museums, delicious food or shops didn\u2019t surprise us as much as the hippie Freetown Christiania. Located on an island within the city, it came to life as a squatted military area in the early 70s. This anarchist commune is independent of Danish regulations. It has its own set of rules, for example, forbidding theft and hard drugs. It means that the Green Light District, a cannabis market located on Christiania\u2019s streets, can operate uninterrupted. I strongly suggest spending some time walking around and getting to know more about the history and existing housing regulations which I find quite amusing since Christiania originated as a squatter utopia. In total we spent 6 days on bikes, covering 730km. We rode gravel/touring bikes with 35-42mm tyres. For navigation, we used a mix of Komoot and bike route signs in Sweden, which worked well. This trip not only got us around Kattegat, but also marked our completion of cycling along the Swedish southern coastline (from Stockholm to Gothenburg). On our previous bikepacking trip we cycled from Stockholm to Ystad. That journey is described in previous blog post: Bikepacking & wild camping in Sweden .

In May 2023, we embarked on an incredible bikepacking journey on gravel bikes. Following the routes of L\u2019Eroica and Via Francigena, we passed through small towns, over hills, and along roads lined with cypress trees, uncovering the true essence of Tuscany. Our adventure led us to the Giro d\u2019Italia, a big three-week bike race. We got to see two parts of it - a fast finish in Viareggio and the start of a stage in Camaiore the next day. Route Tuscany Trail Bikepacking Distance: 490km Elevation: 7300m Time: 8 days Date: May 2023 We followed a segment of the Tuscany Trail official route, captured in a comprehensive Komoot collection that we used for planning. Because of the Giro d\u2019Italia schedule, we had to adapt our plan to reach Viareggio (marked with point A on the Komoot map) before Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, we parked the car at Camping Campeggio Il Treccolo near Siena and began the journey from there, heading north-west to Viareggio. Our timing was spot-on, as 4 days later we arrived at the Stage 10 finish line two hours before the Giro riders. The next day, after cheering on cyclists at the group start in Camaiore, we cycled to Pisa and caught a train to Orbetello (point B on the map) to follow the bikepacking route back to where we started. We did the route in mid May hoping for sunny weather and milder temperatures relative to the scorching summer months. We were unlucky with our timing. That week heavy rains hit Italy, causing floods in the Emiglia Romana region, just north of Tuscany. Effects on our route were not as severe. It \u201cjust\u201d rained for most of our trip. Temperature-wise I was quite happy about my decision to take a down sleeping bag, which I also used on trips to Iceland and Norway, as it was pretty chilly at night. During the day the temperature was ideal for cycling, oscillating around 20 degrees Celsius. Strade Bianche to Siena Tuscany\u2019s white gravel roads are famed as the venue for the Strade Bianche race, widely acclaimed as one of the most captivating and picturesque one-day classics. Our adventure began by following the race route, with the stunning sight of Siena emerging on the horizon. Despite majestic dark clouds accompanying us all the time, it did not rain until nightfall when we reached our campsite. Via Francigena: The Ancient Route from Canterbury to Rome The Via Francigena is an ancient road and pilgrimage route running from the cathedral city of Canterbury in England, through France and Switzerland, to Rome. It\u2019s possible to cover the whole route on a bike. See Eurovelo 5 for more details. The majority of the Via Francigena in Tuscany follows gravel roads but there are some single-track sections through the woods. These gravel roads have very low traffic volumes. Along the way we passed wineries, farmhouses, old churches and rode through the stunning towns of San Gimignano, Monteriggioni and Siena. Because of heavy rainfall, much of the single-track section of Via Francigena was especially challenging to ride - as the rocks became slippery and the trail got very muddy. On one occasion we were forced to cross a stream. Thanks to our lightweight bikepacking setup and thick 45mm tyres the route was rideable. However, other bikepackers with heavy panniers were compelled to seek alternative routes along smooth tarmac roads. Viareggio, Camaiore and Pisa Viareggion and Camaiore were our top priorities, as we really wanted to immerse ourselves in the Giro d\u2019Italia atmosphere. We also wanted to see riders on their cool road bikes. Our Giro experience is captured in the next section of the post. The landscape changed in the north of Tuscany. As the route got closer to the coast, the endless gravel roads and rolling hills gave way to flatter sections with breathtaking mountain views rising from the horizon. After seeing a sprint finish in Viareggio and a group start in Camaiore the following day, we cycled to Pisa to catch a train to Orbetello. Then, we resumed our journey from Tuscany\u2019s south. Orbetello, Pitigliano, Sorano The southern region of Tuscany was a captivating accent on our journey. It involved cycling on the coastline trails and beaches near Orbetello, riding through the medieval towns of Pitigliano and Soreno and climbing to the highest point of our journey - a fortress in Radicofani located 850m above sea level. Each rolling hill we conquered along the route brought us closer to the most scenic part of Tuscany - Val d\u2019Orcia. Val d\u2019Orcia: Montepulciano and Pienza Val d\u2019Orcia is located south of Siena and in the north-east of the volcanic mountain Monte Amiata. Its name derives from the river Orcia, which runs through the valley. Renaissance towns like Pienza, Montepulciano and Montalicino are well-preserved as the area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We were spoilt here by countless espressos, delicious cheese, and my all-time favourite wines: Vino Nobile and Brunello. Each town in the region is usually located on a hill. Which means a lot of cycling up if you are keen to explore the old cities or just want an espresso with a view. There are no stores between the cities (we learned it the hard way) so plan accordingly. We pitched our tent for the night at Podere Il Casale - an organic farm located on a hill just between Pienza and Montepulciano, with a superb restaurant serving their own produce. We spent the last day of our trip visiting Pienza, Montepulciano and San Quirico d\u2019Orcia. As we got closer to our car, we once again hit the white gravel section of the Strade Bianche. It was the perfect way to say goodbye to Tuscany on a bike. Giro d\u2019Italia The Giro d\u2019Italia, a 3 week multi-stage race around Italy, is one of the world\u2019s most famous sporting events. Its history began in 1909 when La Gazzetta dello Sport organized the first race. Since then, there have been 106 editions of it. The race is accompanied by an electric atmosphere, with cheering crowds, colorful flags , and the exhilarating sound of whirring wheels. Watching a sprint finish in Viareggio was an unforgettable experience. The breakaway kept the peloton distanced, thanks to heavy rain and a hilly section preceding the long straight before the finish line. There were only three riders in the breakaway. They all fought for victory in a sprint. Magnus Cort, a Dutch cyclist with a cool blonde moustache, crossed the finish line first. The following day we cycled to Camaiore to attend the team presentation and group start. We got some race-branded swag from the advertisers\u2019 caravan . I didn\u2019t follow the team presentation as I took pictures of beautiful race bikes instead. Factor and Canyon were winners for me. Also, to my surprise, pro riders don\u2019t need to overcompensate themselves with excessively loud freehubs\u2026 Camping We came prepared to spend every night in a tent, hoping for pleasant weather. Unfortuantely, due to heavy rains on a few occasions we had to take other accommodation to dry our stuff and avoid flooding our tent at night. We spent 4 nights camping and 3 nights in apartments. Here are the campsites we visited and liked: Chianti Glamping Village - Situated far from Siena, next to vineyards and wineries producing Chianti. The name is misleading as it\u2019s also possible to pitch a tent. Camping Le Balze Volterra - Camping in Volterra city. Seems popular among bikepackers since we met a few. The city is 550m above sea level, so it is colder than in the valley. Camping Feniglia - Quiet camping near Orbetello by the seaside. Podere il Casale - Organic farm with a few spots to pitch a tent. There is a great restaurant serving their own produce and local wine. Make sure to check this out if you ride through Val d\u2019Orcia. Bike Setup The bike model is Canyon Grizl AL 6 with 45mm wide tyres.

Welcome to the recap of my first (and hopefully not last!) ultra gravel race - 2023 Gravmageddon. Gravmageddon Gravmageddon is an ultra-endurance race in the Karkonosze and Jizera Mountains. It offers many climbs, serious elevation gain, and some awesome gravel sections that can unexpectedly change into challenging rocky paths. The 360km long route with 7,600m of elevation gain guarantees satisfaction at the finish line. Most riders will try to cycle the lengthy route in one go, with breaks only long enough to resupply and eat non-gel food at pitstops or grocery stores. The extensive distance forces you to cycle at night along remote, gravel roads and singletracks in the mountains. The strategic choices riders have to make, along with the physical demands and stunning location in the Karkonosze Mountains, create the race\u2019s unique allure and make it so fun to race. Race Route Gravmageddon 2023 Distance: 360km Elevation: 7400m Time: 30 hrs Date: Aug 2023 Gravmageddon 2023 was definitely a fight against elevation gains and steep climbs. Instead of thick off-road tires, a proper climbing gear ratio would be more useful - at least this is what I realized during the race while fighting steep climbs with my 11-34 cassette \u2026 Climbing Highlights Przesieka - Karkonosze Pass : 7km / elevation gain 670m\u2191 Dolni Stepanice uphill : 9km / 450m\u2191 Liberec - Jested : 7.4km / 518m\u0000\u0000\u2191 Hejnice - Smedava : 10.5km / 470m\u2191 \u015awierad\u00f3w Zdr\u00f3j - St\u00f3g Izerski : 8km / 515m\u2191 The 30 Hours of Racing The race had a rolling start. From 6am on, every 5 minutes, a group of riders would start. My friend dude cycling and I managed to secure early slots with the 6.20am group so that we could maximise cycling in daylight. The race started in Szklarska Por\u0119ba, and after a short uphill, we quickly got onto Droga Pod Reglami, which led us to the hardest climb of the race. Upon reaching the steep section of the road to Karkonosze Pass, I realised two things. Firstly, the stock GRX 11-34 cassette is not suitable for climbs like that, as I had to push the pedals much harder than I had wished. Secondly, most riders carried less stuff; at first I was surprised by their choice, but then I understood that we might have made a strategic mistake by fully loading our bikes at the start. Gravmageddon offers pit stops at 95 and 270km, where you can send equipment to wait for you later in the race. For example, instead of riding and climbing with all of our night gear in the saddle bags, we could have sent it to pit stop 1. We\u2019ve just sent our food, and it was not an optimal decision. The right strategy can make races like this at least a bit easier. That\u2019s my lesson for the future. After reaching the Karkonosze Pass, we descended on a fast tarmac road into the Czech Republic. Around 70km of good tarmac and light gravel roads led us to pit spot 1 on Polana Jakuszycka. At this point, we\u2019ve already had 2700m of elevation gain in our legs. We resupplied, ate fruits and some proper food, and naturally chilled a bit with coffee \u2615\ufe0f! Ahead of us, we had 270km with a looming climb to Jested in Liberec. Rolling hills, going up just to go down, are the only things I can recall from the next section. I only \u201cwoke up\u201d near Liberec when we started the big climb to Jested. At the top of Jested, there is a famous tower and a viewing spot. The climb is perfectly suitable (and probably more enjoyable) for road bikes. We stopped there for a while to stretch, catch a breath, and dress up before the long descent. The night caught around the 250km mark. It was a beautiful part of the route. It included the Smedava climb with a cloudless sky full of stars. The road types changed from gravel and smooth tarmac to bumpy single tracks and rocky mountain paths. Riding on singletracks at 1am on my loaded gravel bike worked better than coffee. The rush of adrenaline on fast technical descents gave me an energy boost to reach pit stop 2 around 3am. We\u2019ve had 290km and 5900m of elevation gain so far. Around the 300km mark, the forecasted heavy rains hit us, and the apparent temperature, as reported by my Wahoo, dropped to 6 degrees Celsius. The weather, along with especially rocky paths, made the last section seem like a never-ending task. We rode quite slowly and had to stop for the famous pancakes at Chatka G\u00f3rzyst\u00f3w just to be able to make it to the end. We reached the finish line cold, wet, and full of mud, but extremely happy to participate in such an amazing event. All in all, I enjoyed the race route a lot. Shoutout to the race organisers for their awesome job! Also, I\u2019m a huge fan of the Gravmageddon cycling cap design. In the front, you can see \u201cWytrwajcie do ko\u0144ca wy konie\u201d which roughly translates to \u201eKeep it up till the end\u201d. And the pattern that goes around the head depicts the race\u2019s elevation profile, with notable climbs. Strava activity for anyone interested. My Bike Setup Bike I raced on my trusty Canyon Grizl AL 6 with 45mm wide tyres, running tubeless, and a standard 2x10 GRX 400 groupset: 46/30 crankset and 11-34 cassette. My biggest takeaway from the race was that a bigger cassette is an absolute must for hilly routes. I took this pic of my bike during a different trip in the Karkonosze Mountains. For the race I did not install the handlebar bag and my saddle bag was not packed as much. Bags and Equipment Given the unpredictable weather conditions and potentially cold night I decided to pack more things just to stay on the safe side. I used the following bags: Ortlieb seatpack (rolled down and compressed) - It stored my rain jacket, Nano Puff jacket, base layer, leg warmers, gloves and Buff scarf. This bag proved many times to be completely waterproof, so I stored there stuff that had to stay dry. Topeak 4.5L frame bag - I put there tools, TPU tubes, tubeless repair kit (It was useful!), food, powerbank and headlamp - anything that could get wet as this bag is not fully waterproof. 1L Apidura top tube bag - I love it for its magnetic rivets to quickly access important stuff, I had my phone and documents there. This bag is waterproof. 2 x 1L handlebar packs fully packed with food. Cockpit I used a Wahoo Element Bolt for navigation. I made sure to set it to the most energy efficient mode, as I wanted to avoid charging it during the forecasted rains. With the backlight set to \u201cauto\u201d, diodes turned off, my phone Bluetooth disconnected and just a single sensor: my chest strap - the battery life on a single charge was even more than the advertised 15 hours. The GPS navigation worked great, even in the mountains. Strong front lamp with sufficient battery is a must when racing at night. I settled for a recommendation from my friend: a bike lamp from AliExpress with replaceable batteries. Surprisingly, I discovered that proprietary lamp batteries are readily available in Poland. For the race I was equipped with 2 batteries, each with 3350mAh, which allowed me to cycle through the night with the lamp set to 400 lumens. I can honestly recommend this lamp (Enfitnix Navi800) as a cheaper alternative to established solutions. Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with this brand.

The motto of our journey. This year for the first time, we ditched rear racks and panniers in favour of a much lighter bikepacking setup. It paid off, as climbing from fjords, at sea level, to high mountain passes and glaciers suddenly became feasible. With an elevation gain of 14,000m, our journey was mostly about long uphills and rewarding views. Even seemingly flat segments would become zigzags when zooming in on the Komoot elevation profile. The weather was also a challenge. Packing so light, we had to carry everything we needed to cycle in the scorching sun, heavy rains or thunderstorms with snow lying around high up in the mountains. This year, I packed a proper camera to capture moments from our adventure. Welcome to the coverage of our 2022 Norway bikepacking trip. Route Bikepacking along fjords and glaciers Distance: 930km Elevation: 14200m Time: 9 days Date: Jul 2022 We followed a segment of the Bikepacking Around Norway race ( Komoot route ). We started at Trondheim airport and had to cover 1000km and 14,000m of elevation gain to make it on time for our flight back from Bergen. The route led us along bike paths, remote roads and gravel sections. There were many uphills and downhills, and even when cycling around the fjords, we rarely had flat segments. We\u2019ve never had issues with tunnels as the race organizers checked that all tunnels have a cycling bypass or are cycling friendly. We heard stories from other bike packers that they had to take a lengthy diversion to avoid long tunnels where cycling is forbidden. During our trip, we discovered this tunnel map created by the bikepacking community. It can serve as a helpful reference when planning a route. Some interesting spots on our route included Trollstigen - a famous serpentine road, Geirangerfjord and Sognefjellet - the highest mountain pass in Norway. On our way, we had four ferry crossings which are usually free of charge for cyclists. Wildcamping The freedom to stay and camp anywhere in nature is taken from the Everyman\u2019s Right (Norwegian Allemannsretten). It is a customary right of everyone to enjoy nature regardless of ownership of the land. It\u2019s permitted to wild camp for a maximum of 2 nights in the same spot, on uncultivated land and at least 150m from the nearest house. During our trip, we had no problem finding wild camping spots. We camped in different locations, near lakes, fjords and forests. Journey Days 1-3: Norwegian climbing prelude I could see forests, snow-topped peaks, lakes and immense masses of clouds through the cabin window as the plane descended towards Trondheim airport. Norway welcomed us with rain. It was only 13 degrees outside. A chilly temperature struck us as we exited the plane. Upon arrival at the airport\u2019s main hall with our bikes packed in boxes, we learned that nothing gets lost in nature. Other bikepackers approached us, asking us to reuse our cardboard boxes. They also shared stories and gave tips for our journey. The most helpful advice was to ditch Apple weather in favour of a local weather provider, yr.no , which works fantastic for that region. Soon, we finished assembling our bikes, mounted the bags, and put on our warm, rainproof clothes. We were ready for the adventure to begin. The first two days of the trip were the coldest. I was unhappy with my choice of leaving GoreTex gloves and winter leg warmers at home. It was windy, cold, with constant drizzle. We spent the first night wild-camping on a lake. The temperature dropped so low that I felt cold in my 0 degrees comfort sleeping bag. On the second day, we cycled up to Oppdal, a ski resort town. It was still chilly outside, but at least it stopped raining. Camping in the forest near the city allowed us to get breakfast from a local supermarket. The constant cold weather worried me as we planned to climb high mountain passes. Luckily, on the third day of the journey, the weather got a bit better, and the weather forecast for the coming days improved. On our third night, we wild camp at Langfjorden with spectacular fjord views. It was a great spot to recover before coming days full of long climbs. Days 4-7: Up, up, up That was the most beautiful part of the trip. It finally became less rainy, and from time to time, we could even see the sun burst through the thick layer of clouds. Better weather made us start the most challenging part of our trip in a good mood. Four challenging climbs awaited us: Trollsteigen, then two uphills around Geirangerfjord, and finally Sognefjellet mountain pass, which took us to 1428m. Another challenge was food. There were (surprisingly!) no grocery stores high up in the mountains. Carrying all the necessary food up the mountains was not feasible as we wanted to save weight during the climb, and also our bags were already packed to their limits. Therefore, after every climb, we still had to cycle an extra distance to reach an open grocery store down in the valley. Trollstiegen Trollstigen is one of the most visually stunning cycling climbs I\u2019ve ever done. The climb starts at Romsdalsfjorden and sneaks up the dramatic, rocky mountainside to 870m. It has 11 famously sharp turns and the average gradient for the central part of the climb hovers around 8%. Geiranger To begin our main climb that day, we first had to reach Geiranger by M\u00f8llsbygda. It meant starting our day with 630m of uphill and steep descent to the Geirangerfjord. We took a short break in the village, and soon we were off to a 1000m climb that spanned almost 17km. With the surroundings created by the ice age, when glaciers carved out fjords and sculpted the high mountains, calling this route impressive is an understatement. Sognefjellet Sognefjellet is northern Europe\u2019s highest mountain pass, reaching 1428m. It was a long 50km climb, starting in Lom. It took us almost 5 hours of cycling uphill to get to the top. Upon reaching the highest point on the road, we could see the glacier\u2019s blue tongue. Fortunately, we snapped a few pictures at the top before the forecasted thunderstorms and heavy rain started. We were in luck - just 100m away, there was an excellent tourist shelter where we waited for almost 2 hours hoping for the weather to improve. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t, so we put on rain jackets and every warm layer we had and proceeded to a long, rainy and windy descent to Lustrafjorden. Day 8-10: One more climb, and soon Bergen The weather changed completely. Instead of cold and rain, we had to ride in scorching sun and heat. After passing the last 1000m \u201ctooth\u201d on the route elevation profile, we were done with substantial climbs and had a relatively flat segment to Bergen. The rainiest city in Europe didn\u2019t disappoint us. It rained for almost 100% of our time there. Looking for shelter, we entered a fish market next to the harbour. There we had a proper seafood feast and some beers. On the last day of the trip, we cycled to Trek Bergen bike shop, as we had asked them to save cardboard bike boxes for us. They did it for free!

The first weekend of May 2024 turned out to be the perfect time for this adventure, as the weather was ideal, and the 1st and 3rd of May were public holidays in Poland. On short notice, we decided to go for it, starting from Kostrzyn in Poland and cycling north along the Oder toward the Baltic Sea. When we reached the Szczecin Lagoon, the Oder estuary, we circled the lagoon, beginning on the German side, and completed our loop in the city of Szczecin on the Polish side. The route was mostly a paved bike path with some light gravel sections and included two ferry crossings. Oder River and Szczecin Lagoon Distance: 400km Elevation: 800m Time: 3 days Date: May 2024 It took us three days to cover 400 km; paved bike paths and a helpful tailwind kept our pace up. We spent two nights at campsites: Campingplatz am Oderstrom in Mescherin, right next to the cycling route along the Oder River. You should arrive by 8PM to check in and receive the shower tokens. Campingplatz Kamminke in Kamminke, situated on the northern edge of the Szczecin Lagoon. Arrivals need to be before 7PM to collect keys to the facilities. It was a fantastic start to the bikepacking season and an excellent warm-up for our upcoming trips this year. The route is well-maintained, featuring clear signage and plenty of spots to stop for a break. I believe it\u2019s an ideal choice for anyone looking to try bikepacking for the first time. Oder River Cycle Route The Oder river cycle route is part of the Oder-Neisse Cycle Path , which follows the two rivers along the border between Germany and Poland. From the point of our start - Kostrzy\u0144, near Frankfurt (Oder) - the route follows to the Oderbruch marshland and the Lower Oder Valley National Park. Near Mescherin, the River Oder bends towards Szczecin in Poland, while the cycle path heads in the direction of Ueckerm\u00fcnde and the Baltic Sea. Lower Oder Valley National Park The bike path took us through the Lower Oder Valley National Park, a sprawling 10,000-hectare sanctuary of wetlands, meadows, and forests. This protected area is a haven for diverse bird species, including gray herons, storks, and swans, among with many others. The park\u2019s rich biodiversity highlights its importance as a key ecological zone, underscoring the conservation efforts by Germany and Poland that aim to preserve this habitat. Szczecin Lagoon Upon reaching \u015awinouj\u015bcie on the Polish side, we made another ferry crossing and followed a stretch of Eurovelo 10 . After arriving in Wolin, we turned south towards Szczecin, following the Szczecin Lagoon Cycle Route . The eastern part of our loop traced the Blue Velo trail, with significant portions running directly along the shores of Lake D\u0105bie and the Szczecin Lagoon. This offered ample opportunities to immerse ourselves in nature and engage in birdwatching. The route predominantly consisted of gravel paths with some paved sections and was exceptionally well-maintained, making it a pleasure to ride on a loaded gravel bike.

Winter in central Europe can be tough\u2026 Tired of indoor training and short runs, I dreamed of a longer stay in a warmer climate this winter. Unlike my shorter trips to Tenerife and Mallorca , this year I managed to spend a month working and cycling in Calpe, on the Spanish Costa Blanca. Staying in Calpe Staying in Calpe meant finding a spot near the action but affordable, close to grocery stores and with good internet for work. We landed an apartment in Edificio Xanadu, not far from Calpe\u2019s old town. The view of Ifach from our cliffside spot was unbeatable, even if the apartment had its quirks. The convenient location eliminated the need for a car rental. Edificio Xanadu , a creation of Ricardo Bofill, stood out as a local landmark, situated near the La Muralla Roja (Red Wall) and El Anfiteatro , forming an intriguing \u201cRicardo Bofill\u201d complex on a cliff overlooking Calpe. Interestingly, the architecture of Muralla Roja was a significant influence on the architectural themes in the Netflix series Squid Game. Living in Calpe allowed us to work until 4 PM on weekdays, yet still go on 50-70km rides, covering famous climbs like Coll de Rates or Bernia, and return just after sunset, utilizing the 2.5-3 hours of daylight for cycling. Weekends and days off allowed for longer rides over 100km, after which we\u2019d still have time to relax on the sandy beach just below our cliffside home. Even in March, the weather was ideal for chilling on a beach, and the sea was invitingly cool for a dip. Cycling in Costa Blanca Why is Calpe so popular for cycling? It offers mountains with stunning views and famous climbs - pros snag all the KOMs here, showing the performance gap between \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d. Just check out this Col de Rates KOM attack . The roads are quiet, in great condition, and the drivers are friendly and respectful. But the best thing? Calpe\u2019s weather. In this Spanish Costa Blanca, winters are mild and sunny. We had just one rainy day in March. It truly is a cycling paradise. I won\u2019t delve into specific routes here, but if you\u2019re interested, check out this Komoot collection of our favorite rides this year. Some of the must-visit spots for cyclists are: Coll de Rates - The most iconic climb in Costa Blanca. Don\u2019t miss the turn to Tossal dels Diners for an incredible view and a challenging ascent. Bernia - This climb offers breathtaking views from the Sierra Bernia peaks with an enjoyable descent towards Benissa. La Vall d\u2019Ebo - My top pick, particularly the climb from Castell de Castells and downhill to Pego. Cap de San Antoni - Near X\u00e0bia, this cape features a lighthouse and dramatic cliffside roads, perfect for photography. Puerto de Tudons - One of the highest accessible points in Costa Blanca for cyclists. Puig de la Llorenca - Known for its challenging steep sections with gradients of 15-18%, and stunning views overlooking Calpe. Cap de la Nau - A picturesque rocky cape with a lighthouse, offering scenic vistas. Zitronen Pass - A beautiful mountain pass from Pedreguer to Alcalal\u00ed, surrounded by citrus groves ( Komoot segment ). Parcent, Xal\u00f3 - Ideal spots for a break, featuring cyclist-friendly cafes like VeloSol and Musette. Where to find a cappuccino without cream? Finding good coffee in Calpe was tougher than expected. Specialty coffee seems off the radar in many local cafes, untouched by the third wave coffee movement. Spain\u2019s habit for sweetening coffee was anticipated (after experiencing Cortado Condensado in Tenerife), but the widespread practice of adding cream to cappuccinos in Calpe was a genuine surprise, with some places even lacking a cream-free option. Despite hopes for a more extensive list, only a few spots made the cut for quality coffee. It\u2019s worth noting that several bike shops in Calpe also serve coffee, though I didn\u2019t get the chance to try them. Musette : A cycling caf\u00e9 and shop in Alcalal\u00ed near Calpe. Loved both the espresso and flat white there, and their Rocket Espresso machine really caught my eye. Velosol : Located in Xal\u00f3, it\u2019s popular in a good way. There\u2019s plenty of space to park bikes and enjoy a seat on the patio, plus you can catch live cycling on TV while sipping coffee outside. Madness Benidorm : This caf\u00e9 and roastery sits on the seafront in Benidorm. It\u2019s not specifically a cycling spot, but the coffee and overall vibe were great. A random stop that turned out to be a highlight! Flying with a bike I finally decided to buy a hard-shell bike bag, which was cost-effective since a month\u2019s rental was about 25% of the purchase price. I went for the B&W Bike Guard Curv, having rented it before and knowing it fits my Canyon Ultimate perfectly. It\u2019s lightweight yet extremely durable; in fact, many triathlon stores use them for their rental gear, and they withstand a lot of use. The bag weighs roughly 10kg, and with my bike being under 8kg, I had a 12kg limit to pack everything else. The 30kg bike bag, along with a slightly oversized backpack (don\u2019t mention this to Ryanair), was sufficient for packing for nearly a month-long stay. The bike survived the flight unscratched :) What\u2019s next? I enjoyed the trip so much that I\u2019m planning to make winter cycling trips a yearly ritual. Tenerife is on my radar for the winter of 2025, but I\u2019m open to suggestions!

The team is responsible for the development and maintenance of Yelp\u2019s search and ranking infrastructure, a crucial part of our ecosystem, that allows for business search, reviews search and powers the internal real-time ad bidding system. At that time, I was part of an initiative to revamp our core search & ranking infra in terms of performance and cost efficiency. This effort resulted in an open-source project - nrtsearch - which, as of early 2023, is used for the majority of search and ranking use cases at Yelp, with more migrations underway set to replace Elasticsearch. With nrtsearch our p50s, p95s and p99s improved by 30-50% while costs dropped by as much as 40% in some cases. You can read more about the nrtsearch project results in the blog post from Yelp\u2019s Engineering Blog: Nrtsearch: Yelp\u2019s Fast, Scalable and Cost Effective Search Engine Nrtsearch development was led by senior folks, industry experts who know ins and outs of Apache Lucene - the core search library on top of which nrtsearch was built. I worked on well-scoped projects, like scalable ingestion, logging, plugin development and scatter-gather service, which allows for application-level cluster sharding. While I enjoyed those projects, I feel that, for a long time, I treated the nrtsearch core search functionality as a black-box - not fully understanding its internals. Therefore, I decided to take a step back, explore, and understand Apache Lucene - a search library at the core of nrtsearch and Elasticsearch (Elastic - a company built around Elasticsearch has a market cap of 5B$). This is the first tech blog post from the series Exploring Apache Lucene in which I\u2019ll describe, in the bottom-up manner, the building blocks of modern search engines. Lucene\u2019s jargon Before starting, I want to explain some terms closely linked to Apache Lucene. They don\u2019t necessarily map 1:1 to other DB technologies, what is at times confusing when reading Lucene\u2019s docs and related blog posts. document - a record, the unit of search and index, a set of fields. Documents are added to a Lucene index, and can be retrieved by a search query. field - a typed slot in a document. A field is a sequence of terms. Document can have multiple fields. term - a value from the source document, the unit of search. Used for building the inverted index index - a collection of documents, typically with the same schema. inverted index - an internal data structure that maps terms to documents by ID, efficient for text-search queries. stored fields - an array of all field values per field, in document order, stored in index in non-inverted manner. Efficient for getting many field values for a few docs. doc values - Lucene\u2019s column-stride field value storage. Efficient for getting a few field values for many docs. Useful for sorting and faceting. index segments - Lucene indexes may be composed of multiple sub-indexes, or segments. Each segment is a fully independent index, which could be searched separately. Representing data with Lucene Inverted Index Inverted index is a data structure that maps terms (i.e. words or phrases) to the documents that contain them. The index is built by analyzing the text of the documents and extracting terms from them. The inverted index allows for fast and efficient searching by providing a way to look up documents that contain a specific term or set of terms. It also provides a way to rank the relevance of the search results by determining how many of the search terms match to a specific document. The inverted index is composed of two substructures: term dictionary - groups all the terms included in the documents in a sorted list. postings list - creates a list of each term, indicating the documents where the term appears. In the above example we can see three documents indexed into Lucene\u2019s inverted index. Each of the document\u2019s conten is analyzed (tokenized) into terms which are inserted into inverted index. Since the terms in the dictionary are sorted, we can quickly find a term (think binary search), and subsequently its occurrences in the postings-structure. This is contrary to a \u201cforward index\u201d, which lists terms related to a specific document. DocValues Inverted index builds a mapping of terms found in all the documents in the index to a list of documents that the term appears in. This makes search very fast - since users search by terms, having a ready list of term-to-document values makes the query process faster. For other features that are associated with search, such as sorting, faceting, and highlighting, this approach is not very efficient. The faceting engine, for example, must look up each term that appears in each document that will make up the result set and pull the document IDs to build the facet list. DocValue fields are column-oriented fields with a document-to-value mapping built at index time - an uninverted (forward) index. This approach can make lookups for faceting, sorting, and grouping much faster, as we can retrieve fields for multiple docs with the single disk seek (utilizing the filesystem cache). DocValues should be preferred over \u201cstored fields\u201d unless the complete document is being retrieved by a query. Stored Fields Similar to DocValues, Stored fields have been created to effectively persist values (differently to how inverted index does it) of the document fields, and then, retrieve them when needed. Stored fields are organised in a row manner. This means that, given a set of fields, for each document, the values of these fields are concatenated in a row. The rows are then stored sequentially on disk according to their Lucene doc id. Each row may have a different size depending on the number of fields defined for that document and data types (e.g. string or text fields have variable sizes). The pointers to each row are stored for allowing fast access to them. This technique is particularly useful if our search query needs to return complete documents (with all their fields) rather than just a few fields. DocValues and Stored fields approached are not mutually exclusive settings, a given field, apart from being indexed into the inverted index, can have DocValues and Stored fields enabled. The queries that will be run against the index should determine which of these approaches is used. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that both of approached are effectively duplicating data and storing them in a format suitable for specific the access pattern - so enabling both may result in a bloated index size. Insertions When building inverted indexes, we need to prioritize things like: search speed, index compactness, indexing speed and the time it takes for new changes to become visible. Search speed and index compactness are related: when searching over a smaller index, less data needs to be processed, and more of it will fit in memory. Both, particularly compactness, come at the cost of indexing speed. To minimize index sizes, various compression techniques are used. For example, when storing the postings (which can get quite large), Lucene does tricks like delta-encoding - e.g. [1, 9, 420] is stored as [1, 8, 411] - so small numbers can be saved with less bytes. When new documents are added, the index changes are first buffered in memory. Eventually, the index files in their entirety, are flushed to disk. The written files make up an index segment. Lucene index segments are \u201cwrite-once\u201d files: once a segment has been written to permanent storage (to disk), it is never altered. This means that indexes are actually comprised of several files which are each subsets of the full index. To prevent eternal fragmentation of the index, segments are periodically merged. In the example above ( source ) we have two segments, each consisting of a single document. On the right side of the image, we can see a result of a segment merge - where 2 segments are merged to form a new segment. Deletions For each segment, Lucene maintains a per-segment bitset (vector of 0 and 1s). Flipping a bit from 1 to 0 signals to Lucene that a document is deleted. All subsequent searches simply skip any deleted documents. It is not until segments are merged that the bytes consumed by deleted documents are reclaimed, as after the merge the resulting segment won\u2019t contain deleted documents. Deleting the documents in-place in the existing segment would be far too costly. Updates Updating a previously indexed document is a \u201ccheap\u201d delete followed by a re-insertion of the document. This means that updating a document is even more expensive than adding it in the first place. Thus, storing things like rapidly changing values in a Lucene index is probably not a good idea \u2013 there is no in-place update of values. Visualising Lucene\u2019s segment merges Below there is a visualisation of how Lucene handles insertions, deletion and segment merges (taken from this great blog post by Michael McCandless). Each segment is a bar, whose height is the size (in MB) of the segment. Segments on the left are the largest; as new segments are flushed, they appear on the right. The dark grey band on top of each segment shows the proportion of deletions in that segment. Lucene\u2019s data storage architecture: pros and cons (-) Document insertions require writing a new segment. Which can be costly for single-document insertions. Therefore bulk inserts are preferred. (+) Segments are never modified in-place, so they are filesystem cache-friendly. Segments can be searched concurrently lock-free, with no risk of race conditions. It also allows for concurrent query execution. (+) The inverted index allows for fast and efficient searching by providing a way to look up documents that contain a specific term or set of terms. (+) Terms compression. Deduplication of terms within a segment, it can save a lot of space for very high-frequency terms. (+) Terms are uniquely identified by an ordinal, useful for sorting and faceting. (+) DocValues optimization can help with efficient sorting and faceting. Stored fields can help with retrieving whole documents.

In this tutorial, I\u2019m using my blog as an example dataset, but you can apply this approach to index any kind of data. The plan is to build a simple web crawler to fetch website\u2019s data. Then we start a local nrtsearch cluster with a primary and replicas, design its index schema and set up an indexing pipeline for the search engine. Finally, we define nrtsearch queries to support custom scoring and highlighting. A simple search UI will allow us to interact with the system. All of this will be done with minimal coding. I will use open-source libraries to keep things simple and extensible. You can clone the tutorial code repo to run the code locally. All you need is python3 and Docker installed on your system. If you want to learn more about nrtsearch, check out Yelp\u2019s Engineering blog post: Nrtsearch: Yelp\u2019s Fast, Scalable and Cost Effective Search Engine Let\u2019s start! Web crawler The crawler fetches data from websites. In this tutorial I\u2019m using my blog as an example dataset. For simplicity, I supplied a sitemap - a list of urls - so that the crawler can directly fetch the data. I use beautifulsoup library for extracting website content. The website data can be represented in a following way: title - website title tag description - meta description tag, a short summary of the website, provided by the author url - unique website id content - extracted text content, e.g. paragraphs headings - extracted website\u2019s headings, we group h1 , h2 , h3 , \u2026 tags together. Our code uses get_source_urls() function to get the list of urls. The function will process the HTML pages to extract: title, description, content and headings. After it\u2019s done, it will save the output to a JSON file. import json import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup urls = get_source_urls ( ) # urls from website sitemap website_data = [ ] for url in urls : response = requests . get ( url ) soup = BeautifulSoup ( response . content , \"html.parser\" ) title = soup . title . text . strip ( ) if soup . title else None description = ( soup . find ( \"meta\" , attrs = { \"name\" : \"description\" } ) [ \"content\" ] . strip ( ) if soup . find ( \"meta\" , attrs = { \"name\" : \"description\" } ) else None ) headings = [ h . text . strip ( ) for h in soup . find_all ( [ \"h1\" , \"h2\" , \"h3\" , \"h4\" , \"h5\" ] ) ] content = soup . get_text ( \" \" , strip = True ) website_data . append ( { \"url\" : url , \"title\" : title , \"description\" : description , \"headings\" : headings , \"content\" : content , } ) with open ( 'index_resources/website_data.json' , 'w' ) as outfile : json . dump ( website_data , outfile ) The full crawler code is located in crawler/crawler.py , you can run the crawler by executing: make run_crawler Nrtsearch cluster The nrtsearch cluster consists of 2 types of nodes: primary - a single node, responsible for data indexing. It periodically publishes Lucene segment updates to replicas. Hence the name: nrtsearch - near-real time search . replica - one or more nodes, responsible for serving the search traffic. It receives periodic segment updates from the primary. The number of running replicas can be controlled by an auto-scaler (like HPA ) to respond to changing search load. It\u2019s also possible to run the cluster with a single, standalone node, used for both data ingestion and search. It\u2019s ok for experimentation but for production environments it\u2019s recommended to run separate primary and replica nodes. The source code for nrtsearch cluster setup is available in /nrtsearch folder. There we have: Dockerfile to setup an nrtsearch node configs for primary and replicas docker-compose.yaml with example cluster configuration Note: in this tutorial we don\u2019t worry about persisting the index state. If you rebuild your nrtsearch containers, all index state will be lost. In order to persist your index, you can attach a permanent volume to docker containers. For production, it\u2019s advisable to use a dedicated s3 bucket where nrtsearch stores the cluster state - it allows deploying nrtsearch as a stateless service. More about possible configurations in nrtsearch docs . In order to start the local cluster with a primary and two replicas, run a following command in a separate terminal window: make start Above command will run docker compose up that starts the nrtsearch cluster defined in the root docker-compose.yaml file. It will also start a few other services that will be described later. In your terminal window you should see logs indicating that the primary and replicas are ready: primary-node-1 | [ INFO ] 2023 -04-16 12 :12:42.194 [ main ] LuceneServer - Server started, listening on 8000 for messages The address of nrtsearch nodes depends on whether you connect to them from the host machine of from a different docker container. For the host machine, the nrtsearch gRPC server ( 8000 container port) of each node in the cluster is exposed on a host\u2019s physical port. We use port 8000 for the primary node and ports 8001 and 8002 for the two replicas. Within docker containers, we can use docker DNS. primary-node hostname is used to advertise the primary. All replicas run under the replica-node hostname. For all nrtsearch nodes the gRPC server runs on port 8000 . You can run docker compose ps , to see ports assigned to containers. NAME IMAGE COMMAND SERVICE CREATED STATUS PORTS primary-node-1 primary-node \"bash -c '/user/nrts\u2026\" primary-node About an hour ago Up About an hour 0.0 .0.0:8000- > 8000 /tcp replica-node-1 replica-node \"./entrypoint_replic\u2026\" replica-node About an hour ago Up About an hour 0.0 .0.0:8002- > 8000 /tcp replica-node-2 replica-node \"./entrypoint_replic\u2026\" replica-node About an hour ago Up About an hour 0.0 .0.0:8001- > 8000 /tcp Great! Now we have a local nrtsearch cluster with nodes dedicated to data ingestion and search. Even though the containers are now running, no index was created. A new index must be created via a command. Once the index has been started in replicas, they register with the primary. Replication happens only after documents are ingested into the primary. Now, let\u2019s prepare the client code to interact with our cluster. Generate gRPC client code using protoc Clients can communicate with nrtsearch via gRPC or REST API. gRPC is a high-performance remote procedure call framework that enables communication using protocol buffers. This method yields high performance for production applications. The REST API is an optional way to communicate with nrtsearch, suitable for development and experimentation. The REST server ( grpc-gateway ) is autogenerated from proto definitions. Let\u2019s use gRPC to communicate with nrtsearch. Since it\u2019s not a REST API we can\u2019t just curl the endpoints. We need to generate the native client code, python for this tutorial, to interact with nrtsearch nodes. To generate Python client code from nrtsearch proto definitions , you can use the gRPC toolchain\u2019s protoc compiler along with the grpc_tools package to compile the .proto files into Python code. You can then use the generated client code to communicate with the gRPC server. The steps are: get all nrtsearch .proto files along with their dependencies to a folder, let\u2019s call it /protos point protoc compiler to /protos folder and generate the python code In the Makefile there are commands nrtsearch_protos and nrtsearch_protos which execute the steps above. They will put the generated code into nrtsearch_client/yelp/nrtsearch/ . # Generate nrtsearch .proto files and their dependencies nrtsearch_protos : mkdir -p protos docker build -t nrtsearch-protos-builder : latest ./utils/nrtsearch_protos_builder/ docker run -v $ (shell pwd)/protos : /user/protos nrtsearch-protos-builder : latest # Compile client .proto files to python code nrtsearch_protoc : nrtsearch_protos $ ( PYTHON ) -m grpc_tools.protoc \\ --proto_path protos \\ --grpc_python_out nrtsearch_client \\ --python_out nrtsearch_client \\ protos/yelp/nrtsearch/luceneserver.proto \\ protos/yelp/nrtsearch/search.proto \\ protos/yelp/nrtsearch/analysis.proto \\ protos/yelp/nrtsearch/suggest.proto rm -rf protos In order to nrtsearch .proto files and their dependencies we use a simple Dockerfile that compiles the project and moves all proto files into the persistent volume /protos . Then protoc compiler compiles them to python code. After running make nrtsearch_protoc you can verify that the client code was generated successfully: ls nrtsearch_client/yelp/nrtsearch/ analysis_pb2.py luceneserver_pb2.py search_pb2.py suggest_pb2.py analysis_pb2_grpc.py luceneserver_pb2_grpc.py search_pb2_grpc.py suggest_pb2_grpc.py Index schema In order to ingest the data into nrtsearch, we must first create an index and register the fields. Appropriate schema design will enable efficient search and results highlighting for blog data. The blog_search index needs to represent the data returned from the crawler : url, title, description, headings and text content. We use TEXT type for each field, as this allows to the data to be tokenized and indexed with index-time analyzer. The nested field url.id has _ID type - it defines the unique Lucene document id. Note, the url field has TEXT type as we still want to search for keywords within the url Each field is searchable ( search: true ), tokenized ( tokenize: true ) and is stored in column-oriented way ( storeDocValues: true ). The content.analyzed field contains the index-time analyzed webpage content. We define a custom analyzer which removes any html characters ( htmlstrip charFilter), uses standard tokenizer and kStem , stop and lowercase Lucene token filters. In order to support the Fast Vector Highlighter for results highlighting, we set termVectors , store and tokenize properties. The blog_search index schema is located in index_resources/index_schema.yaml and defined as: indexName : blog_search field : - name : url type : TEXT search : true storeDocValues : true tokenize : true childFields : - name : id type : _ID search : true storeDocValues : true - name : title type : TEXT search : true storeDocValues : true tokenize : true - name : description type : TEXT search : true storeDocValues : true tokenize : true - name : headings type : TEXT search : true storeDocValues : true tokenize : true multiValued : true - name : content type : TEXT search : true storeDocValues : true tokenize : true store : true termVectors : TERMS_POSITIONS_OFFSETS childFields : - name : analyzed type : TEXT search : true store : true termVectors : TERMS_POSITIONS_OFFSETS tokenize : true analyzer : custom : charFilters : - name : htmlstrip tokenizer : name : standard tokenFilters : - name : lowercase - name : kStem - name : stop More information about the nrtsearch field types, schema design and supported analyzers is available in the nrtsearch docs . Create nrtsearch index Now it\u2019s time to create and start an index for blog data. We have a running nrtsearch cluster, generated client code and the index schema. To configure the index on primary and replicas, we need to run several requests in order. CreateIndexRequest - creates the nrtsearch index with a given name SettingsRequest - sets Lucene-related index settings StartIndexRequest - starts the index in a given mode ( STANDALONE , PRIMARY or REPLICA ), additionally for replicas we need to specify primary host:port for index replication FieldDefRequest - registers index schema CommitRequest - commits the newly created index. It ensures its state is preserved in s3 or other persistent storage Each docker compose container has assigned a fixed host:port (see docker-compose.yaml ) so I\u2019m using dummy service discovery to discover and communicate with nrtsearch nodes from the host machine: # Simple service discovery for scripts ran from host machine SERVICE_DISCOVERY = { \"primary-node\" : ( \"localhost\" , 8000 ) , \"replica-node-0\" : ( \"localhost\" , 8001 ) , \"replica-node-1\" : ( \"localhost\" , 8002 ) , } In nrtsearch_client/client.py we have the gRPC client which communicates with our cluster nodes: @lru_cache ( 3 ) def get_nrtsearch_client ( host , port ) : channel = grpc . insecure_channel ( f\" { host } : { port } \" ) return LuceneServerStub ( channel ) The script in nrtsearch_client/setup_index.py creates clients for each node and executes the above commands in order, using the protobuf generated code. You can run the script for index setup locally via make setup_index . The process of starting the index is slightly different for replicas and primaries. For example, the start_index_replica() starts the index in REPLICA mode and registers to primary to listen for index updates. The primaryAddress=\"primary-node\" is defined in docker-compose.yaml and the 8001 replication port comes from the primary server configuration . Note that replicas use the internal Docker network to communicate with the primary so we don\u2019t need to expose the replication port. You can verify that the blog_search index is created on each node by running make index_status . The output should look like: IndicesRequest for: primary-node indicesResponse { indexName: \"blog_search\" statsResponse { dirSize: 96 state: \"started\" taxonomy { } currentSearcher { segments: \"IndexSearcher(StandardDirectoryReader(segments_1:2:nrt); executor=ExecutorWithParams(sli ceMaxDocs=250000, sliceMaxSegments=5, virtualShards=1, wrapped=java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@4a bd0a9d[Running, pool size = 0, active threads = 0, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0]))\" } } } IndicesRequest for: replica-node-0 indicesResponse { #... } If you restart the nrtsearch container, you will see that even though the state files are still present in the volume, the index won\u2019t be started. Nrtsearch expects a startIndex command after server restart. In the nrtsearch_client/setup_index.py script we have extra logic to handle following scenarios: blog_search index is not returned from the indices() call. It means that the index doesn\u2019t exist. We need to execute all 5 steps to create an index. blog_search index exists but is not_started . This can happen when you restart a Docker container. We need to just issue the StartIndexRequest . blog_search index exists and it is started - all good, index is already running. Great! Now we have a running nrtsearch cluster and our index is started and replicated between primary and replicas. Let\u2019s move on to data ingestion. Nrtsearch indexer In order to ingest data into nrtsearch we can use the addDocuments client method. It allows streaming multiple AddDocumentRequest to the primary for indexing. A single call to addDocuments can contain multiple documents in the payload. You can call it a bulk update. It\u2019s more efficient when indexing a large amounts of documents. Therefore, it\u2019s advisable to batch your documents and ingest them in bulk for production use-cases. There is no transaction log, so you must call commit periodically to make recent changes durable on disk. This means that if a node crashes, all indexed documents since the last commit are lost. ( docs ) When ingesting our data to nrtsearch we need to call commit periodically to ensure our data is persisted. It works very well with streaming frameworks, like Flink, where you can call commit every time your Flink application checkpoints. The checkpoint is successful if and only if the commit call succeeds. I use a python script, which batches docs and ingests them into the primary and commits the index. Then, we can inspect the replica state to check if index segments were replicated. # For prod cases we can even make it 1000, taking small value for this tutorial BATCH_SIZE = 10 # Load the data processed and saved by the crawler def _load_website_data ( ) : with open ( \"index_resources/website_data.json\" ) as f : data = json . load ( f ) return data # Prepare the request payload def _prepare_document_stream ( docs ) : for doc in docs : fields = { \"url\" : AddDocumentRequest . MultiValuedField ( value = [ doc [ \"url\" ] ] ) , \"title\" : AddDocumentRequest . MultiValuedField ( value = [ doc [ \"title\" ] ] ) , \"description\" : AddDocumentRequest . MultiValuedField ( value = [ doc [ \"description\" ] ] ) , \"headings\" : AddDocumentRequest . MultiValuedField ( value = doc [ \"headings\" ] ) , \"content\" : AddDocumentRequest . MultiValuedField ( value = [ doc [ \"content\" ] ] ) , } yield AddDocumentRequest ( indexName = INDEX_NAME , fields = fields ) # Use gRPC streaming to send documents for ingestion def index_document_stream ( primary_client , doc_stream ) : response = primary_client . addDocuments ( doc_stream ) return response def run_indexer ( ) : # Just index data to primary - data will be replicated to other nodes in the cluster host , port = SERVICE_DISCOVERY . get ( \"primary-node\" ) primary_client = get_nrtsearch_client ( host , port ) website_docs = _load_website_data ( ) # Split data into chunks for bulk ingestion chunked_website_docs = chunked ( website_docs , BATCH_SIZE ) # Process each chunk of docs in bulk for idx , docs_chunk in enumerate ( chunked_website_docs ) : doc_stream = _prepare_document_stream ( docs = docs_chunk ) index_response = index_document_stream ( primary_client , doc_stream ) # Call commit after docs are ingested commit_response = commit_index ( primary_client ) You can start the script by running make run_indexer . After the script is done, let\u2019s check the number of docs in each nrtsearch node - to verify that updates were propagated to replicas. > venv/bin/python nrtsearch_client/get_indices.py IndicesRequest for: primary-node indicesResponse { indexName: \"blog_search\" statsResponse { maxDoc: 21 numDocs: 21 .. . currentSearcher { numDocs: 21 .. . } } } .. . IndicesRequest for: replica-node-1 indicesResponse { indexName: \"blog_search\" statsResponse { .. . } searchers { numDocs: 21 .. . } .. . } } We can see that data was successfully replicated between primary and replica nodes - both report 21 docs in their index. Great! \ud83c\udf89 gRPCox web UI gRPCox is a web UI wrapper for gRPCurl . It\u2019s a simple but useful tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It\u2019s optional for the tutorial but I want to show how it enables ad-hoc communication with the nrtsearch server. The UI was started as one of the services invoked by the make start command and is accessible on localhost:6969 . The primary is advertised under primary-node hostname, and replicas are advertised under replica-node (you can inspect logs to find IP of each replica). The nrtsearch gRPC server runs on port 8000 . Let\u2019s connect to the primary node and run a simple search request to explore the index. Connect to primary at primary-node:8000 Select luceneserver.LuceneServer service. You should then see all available gRPC methods and their schemas. We will use search and pass this query to explore docs in the index (note, since the query field is empty it will return all documents). { \"indexName\" : \"blog_search\" , \"startHit\" : 0 , \"topHits\" : 100 , \"retrieveFields\" : [ \"title\" , \"description\" , \"url\" ] } You should see the search results in the UI. Custom search ranking The Lucene\u2019s scoring algorithm considers the frequency and distribution of terms in the document and query vectors. For our scenario it should suffice to return documents that match the user search query. We can add custom weights to prioritize results that contain the search term inside title , description , headings , url and content . We can start with simple weights, test our system and refine the algorithm as necessary to improve search results. Building Nrtsearch Queries documentation page contains supported query types along with examples and explanations. Since nrtsearch is based on Apache Lucene, its query types map closely to Lucene queries. It\u2019s possible to customize queries for each field based on specific search requirements. You can combine the queries using a BooleanQuery with multiple clauses. For example, you could use a MatchPhraseQuery to search for exact phrases, or a add fuzziness parameters to MatchQuery to search for approximate matches. The search query used for retrieving hits from blog_search index is defined in nrtsearch_client/searcher.py . We combine multiple MatchQuery and MatchPhraseQuery queries to recall and score documents based on their title, description, headings, url and content. Highlighting support Highlights are used to retrieve information about matched terms in a hit. Nrtsearch currently supports the Fast Vector Highlighter in Lucene. Results highlighting is configured in the search request\u2019s highlight field. Nrtsearch returns matched terms in a hit wrapped in pre_tags and post_tags . In this tutorial I use the <em> html tag to emphasize the highlighted content. search_request = SearchRequest ( indexName = 'blog_search' , retrieveFields = [ \"url\" , \"title\" , \"description\" ] , query = Query ( . . . ) , highlight = Highlight ( fields = [ \"content\" , \"content.analyzed\" ] , settings = Highlight . Settings ( pre_tags = [ \"<em>\" ] , post_tags = [ \"</em>\" ] ) , ) , ) To be able to highlight a field with FVH, the following settings must be enabled when registering the field: The field must be a TEXT field The field must be stored: \u201cstore: true\u201d The field must have term vectors with positions and offsets: \u201ctermVectors: TERMS_POSITIONS_OFFSETS\u201d While not mandatory, the field must be tokenized for the highlights to be useful: \u201ctokenize: true\u201d Client-side load balancing Client-side load balancing allows gRPC clients to distribute load optimally across available nrtsearch replica servers. The configuration to distribute the load across replicas, with round robin policy, looks as follows for our python client: def get_search_replica_client ( ) : channel = grpc . insecure_channel ( \"replica-node:8000\" , options = [ ( \"grpc.lb_policy_name\" , \"round_robin\" ) ] ) return LuceneServerStub ( channel ) replica-node is a DNS record that resolves to multiple IPs - each running a gRPC server at port 8000 . The client will distribute requests over the created channel evenly among multiple IPs. In order to verify that replica-node resolves to our replica IPs, we can run a dig command within any of the created docker containers. There are two IP addresses in the response, 172.20.0.6 and 172.20.0.7 , which correspond to the IP addresses of our replicas. dig replica-node ; <<>> DiG 9.18.13 <<>> replica-node ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 25431 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;replica-node.

You can set up Grafana dashboards to see how search traffic is balanced between your running replicas. Search UI Our Search UI is a simple server-side React app. It was bootstrapped with npx create-next-app command. I used @elastic/search-ui React components to define the app UI in less than 100 lines of frontend code . The library supports custom connectors. The Search UI is connected to our searcher API - a simple Flask server with /search endpoint. It was started by running make start and should be accessible on localhost:3000 . You can make a few search queries to see how our custom search ranking works. Putting it all together Configuration for every service mentioned in this tutorial is in the docker-compose.yaml file. In order to start this project locally you need to execute four commands: make start - starts the nrtsearch cluster, search UI and search API server, and the gRPC web UI. It also generates nrtsearch client python code using protoc compiler. make start_index - starts the blog_search index make run_crawler - crawls web data make run_indexer - indexes crawled web data You can access the Search UI on your host machine localhost:3000 to issue search queries. The web UI for sending gRPC commands to nrtsearch is available at localhost:6969 . You can index more web data by editing and adding sources to the crawler.py code. Keep in mind that when crawling websites with scripts, it is crucial to respect the robots.txt file. Some websites, including Wikipedia offer database dumps to limit unnecessary crawling. I hope this tutorial is a helpful introduction to data indexing with nrtsearch.

A great thing about the Sussex Coastal Marathon is that the route includes the Seven Sisters cliffs and offers spectacular views over the English Channel. To be honest, the localisation and the views were the main reason why my flatmate, Eduardo, managed to convince me to sign up a few months ago. Watching the promo of the race got me hooked up and gave me a lot of motivation during the training. Running for the climate change Together with my friend Ed we decided to use this challenge as an opportunity to make a difference. We managed to raise 200\u00a3 , all of which was forwarded to The Climate Group that specialises on the environment. Big thank you to everyone who donated! My experience The marathon was rather a hard one, definitely harder than I had expected. It had almost 1700m (5600ft) of elevation gain. There was quite a few muddy sections of the trail as it was raining the night before the race. During the run it was quite windy with a bit of rain. I was definitely underprepared. My training was mostly based on running in Hyde Park which offers a few flat \u201ctrail\u201d routes. Looking back, I should have included at least some hilly runs in my routine to prepare my legs better. Upon starting the marathon I was confident that I would be able to run all the way to the finish line. I did a few long runs as a part of my training and I felt prepared. To my disappointment, a lot of hilly sections and muddy trail took their toll and made me walk a lot after hitting 30km mark. The result? Time 5hr 17min is definitely not what I was hoping for but it\u2019s a good motivation to carry on with the training to improve myself in the future. I\u2019m already looking forward to new cool challenges I can sign up for. If you have a suggestion, lmk on Twitter! Photos Before the race. Waiting with the others to start. Views of the English Channel at around 30km. Super happy after completing my first marathon. COVID-19 I did ask myself a question of whether or not should I participate. In the end I decided to take a calculated risk. Only a handful of people took part in this race, also the distances between runners were big and the organisers made sure to minimise physical touch points: all the runners were required to carry their own food and water.
