What millimeter wavelength range is suggested as appropriate to look for dynamic signatures in the solar chromosphere according to the computations by Carlsson and Stein?,The appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures in the solar chromosphere are in the range of 0.8-5.0 mm.,"I don't know, but I think it's between 300-500 nanometers.",87.81915712,"It depends on the particular situation. If there is no clear sign of dynamism, then it would be better to use shorter wavelengths.",TRUE,61.28018808
How does the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way vary with cluster half-mass density (rho_h)?,"The turnover mass (M_TO) of the GCMF increases with the half-mass density (rho_h), while the width of the GCMF decreases. This is attributed to the slow erosion of an initially rising mass function through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation.",What is the GCMF of a galaxy?,68.07074499,"The GCMF depends on RHO_H, the ratio of the cluster's total mass to its virial mass.",TRUE,91.88889003
What is the nature of the huge far-infrared luminosity of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117)?,"The huge far-infrared luminosity of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO is predominantly due to a starburst, as indicated by the ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission, which is consistent with lower luminosity star-forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and local PG QSOs.",The answer to this question will be given in a few minutes.,67.52322102,"The nature of the massive star-forming region that hosts this QSO is still unclear.  It may be a typical low-mass X-ray binary or it could be a very massive young galaxy. We have measured the far-infrared emission from the large dust galaxy. We have measured the far-infrared emission from the large dust distribution surrounding the QSO. This distribution has a temperature of about 10^6 K, which is consistent with the presence of a super-dense gas cloud.  However, the size of the cloud is much larger than the radius of the QSO.  This suggests that the QSO is not embedded in a massive galaxy but rather that it is surrounded by a massive clump of material.",TRUE,91.73273087
"What is the behavior of the angular momentum Lz​ for nearly horizon-skimming orbits around a nearly extremal Kerr black hole, and how does this behavior compare to normal black hole orbits?","For nearly horizon-skimming orbits around a nearly extremal Kerr black hole (spin a=J/M>0.9524Ma = J/M > 0.9524Ma=J/M>0.9524M), the angular momentum Lz​ increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior contrasts with normal black hole orbits, where the angular momentum decreases with increasing inclination.","I'm not sure what you mean by ""nearly horizon-skimming"". I think you're asking about the behavior of the angular momentum in the limit where the orbit becomes nearly circular. In that case, it's clear from the equations that the angular momentum should be zero.",46.56550002,"The behavior of the angular momentum Lz​ for nearly horizon-skimming orbits around a nearly extremal Kerr black hole is similar to that of normal black hole orbits. However, there is one important difference. In the case of a near extremal Kerr black hole, the orbital radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so that the total mass M_s of the object is much greater than the Schwarzschild mass M_s = 2GM_s. This means that the orbital velocity v_o is much greater than the escape velocity v_esc. Thus, the orbital period P_o is much longer than the Schwarzschild time t_s. Since the orbital radius is much less than the Schwarzschild radius, the orbital energy E_o is much greater than the Schwarzschild energy E_s. Therefore, the orbital energy E_o / E_s is much greater than the Schwarzschild energy E_s / E_s. This leads to a significant increase in the orbital angular momentum Lz​.",TRUE,146.5579011
What is the spatial relationship between the protostars and T-Tauri members in the IC 348 star cluster?,"The population of protostars is anti-correlated spatially with the T-Tauri members. The T-Tauri members comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star, while the protostars are mostly found at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge.","The protostars are located at a distance of about 1 kpc from the central T-Tauri member, which is approximately 2 kpc away. The protostar is located at a distance of about 0.2 kpc from the T-Tauri member. The T-Tauri member is located at a distance of about 3 kpc from the protostar.",71.85842586,"The spatial distribution of the T-Tauri members is anti-correlated with the spatially resolved protostellar populations. This suggests that the T-Tauri membership is being formed via accretion onto the central B star. The protoplanetary populations are distributed over a wide range of radii, but are concentrated near the center of the cluster. The protostellar populations have a mean radius of Rp = 0.8R⊙, and have a peak at Rp = 2R⊙. The T-Tauri memberships are also correlated with the B star. The B star is located at Rp = 0.6R⊙, and has a peak at Rp = 1.2R⊙.",TRUE,109.9271371
What are the main observational findings regarding the X-ray and radio emissions from the Galactic non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2?,"The X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component. The X-ray emission comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and the X-ray and radio emissions are significantly offset from each other. The radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3.","The first thing to note is that this is a very difficult question, because it requires you to know what we mean by ""non-thermal"" in order to answer it. The term ""non-thermal"" means that there is no thermal radiation coming out of the object, but instead, it's just emitting light or other forms of energy. This can be anything from radio waves to x-rays, depending on where the object is located and how much energy it has available.",68.28754687,"The first observation was made by Chandra, where it was found that the X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 is dominated by a single point source at the center of the galaxy. The second observation was made by Suzaku, where they observed a very bright X-ray source at the same location as G328.4+0.2. This source was later confirmed as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The third observation was made by Swift, where they detected a very bright X-ray source located near the center of the galaxy. This source was later confirmed as a supernova remnant. Finally, the fourth observation was made by Fermi, where they discovered a very bright X-ray source located near the center of the galaxy. This source was later confirmed as a pulsar wind nebula.",TRUE,85.85882187
"What are the unique advantages of radio astrometry in exoplanet discovery compared to other methods like radial velocity searches, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry?","Radio astrometry offers greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. It is particularly suitable for studying nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be efficiently studied through radial velocity methods, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. Additionally, with the future capabilities of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars, and planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.",I think it's a good idea to ask this question on /r/askastronomy because there is so much overlap between astronomy and astrophysics that I don't think we can get away with asking it here.,52.12113833,"Radio astrometry has many advantages over other methods. First, it is very sensitive to small masses (1-10 MJup) and can detect planets around low-mass stars.

What is the determined contribution of the donor star in the H waveband in the spectrum of A0620-00?,The donor star contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82±2%.,"I don't know how to answer that, but I can tell you what we do know: The H waveband has a very strong absorption feature at about 0.5 microns. The main source of this feature is probably the hydrogen line at 1.4 microns. This line is much weaker than the other lines and therefore it is not easy to detect with our instruments. However, if we look at the spectra of stars with similar spectral types (like A0620-00) we can see that they have a weak absorption feature at around 0.5 microns. So we can conclude that the hydrogen line is probably the strongest absorption feature in the spectrum of A0620-00.  This means that the hydrogen line is probably the most important absorber in the spectrum of A0620-00.  So the hydrogen line is probably the most important absorber in the spectrum of A0620-00.  That's all I can say about that.",42.58347607,"It is not clear what you mean by ""donor star"". If it is the same as the one in the spectra of A0620-00, then the contribution should be about 80%.",TRUE,140.7945521

What pattern in Faraday rotation measures (RMs) requires the presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic quadrant?,"The magnitudes of the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the locations of the Galactic spiral arms, requiring the presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic quadrant, located between the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.",The answer is: <|patterns|>,71.2895329,"The magnetic field in the fourth Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm (as viewed from the North Galactic pole) and counter-clockwise in the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone, in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not required to account for observations.",TRUE,83.52798963
